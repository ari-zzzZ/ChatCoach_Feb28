INTRODUCTION

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 33 (Number of characters: 124):
If you’re in immediate distress, please turn to chapter 8, and read the list of 13 steps for reducing
Cptsd fear and stress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 34 (Number of characters: 84):
Forty years ago, I was riding on a train in India travelling from Delhi to Calcutta.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 35 (Number of characters: 64):
I was at
the end of a failed, yearlong spiritual quest in India.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 36 (Number of characters: 96):
Instead of enlightenment, my salvation
fantasy had only netted me despair and amoebic dysentery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 37 (Number of characters: 86):
The latter cost me thirty pounds of
flesh, and left me looking like an emaciated monk.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 38 (Number of characters: 118):
Even worse was the absolute loss of the hope that had been inflamed by reading Walt
Whitman’s “Song of the Open Road.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 39 (Number of characters: 119):
This hope had supported me through five years of world
travel after I was unceremoniously kicked out of my family home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 40 (Number of characters: 23):
But, back to the train.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 41 (Number of characters: 139):
I was sitting in my cramped second class seat with the untouchables,
chickens and goats, reading an English version of an Indian newspaper.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 42 (Number of characters: 153):
The paper informed me
that my destination, Calcutta, was now inundated with 100,000 refugees from Bangladesh who
had just fled their flood–swamped homes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 43 (Number of characters: 155):
They were all apparently sleeping on the downtown
streets in the recesses beneath the protruding second floors of all the buildings that lined the
streets.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 44 (Number of characters: 127):
I came in late at night and sure enough, sleeping bodies wrapped in sheets, shoulder to
shoulder, lined the streets everywhere.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 45 (Number of characters: 85):
I checked into a twenty cents-a-night hotel that a fellow
traveler had told me about.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 46 (Number of characters: 74):
I slept unevenly, dreading the sight that I would behold the next
morning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 47 (Number of characters: 93):
How would I handle viewing masses of desperate people, especially when I had
nothing to give?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 48 (Number of characters: 107):
I doubted that I even had enough money to make it to Australia where I could
hopefully replenish my wallet.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 49 (Number of characters: 121):
When I finally nudged myself down the stairs late the next morning, I was aghast at the
transformed scene on the streets.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 50 (Number of characters: 79):
Sheets had been spread out like picnic blankets and each hosted
happy families.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 51 (Number of characters: 54):
Little portable stoves produced meals and cups of tea.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 52 (Number of characters: 80):
People bantered with
incredible vitality and enthusiasm, and children...children

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 53 (Number of characters: 195):
[this was the part that emblazoned on
my memory] crawled all over their parents, especially their fathers in affectionate playful
gymnastics that their fathers seemed to love as much as they did.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 54 (Number of characters: 137):
I was flooded with a mélange of feelings unlike anything I’d ever experienced before - a
strange cocktail of relief, delight and anxiety.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 55 (Number of characters: 138):
The anxiety I wouldn’t understand until ten years

later when I realized that envy had been percolating below the surface of my awareness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 56 (Number of characters: 116):
I was deeply envious of this gorgeous buffet of familial love that I had never experienced or
even witnessed before.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 57 (Number of characters: 183):
The family sitcoms – even the syrupy sweet ones - that I had watched
growing up came nowhere near creating such an authentic, tactile representation of healthy
bonding and attachment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 58 (Number of characters: 265):
When I realized what this was years later as an anthropology and social work student, I
positively flashed back to other non-industrial countries where I had seen similar scenes on a less
grand level: Morocco, Thailand, Bali, and an Aboriginal reserve in Australia.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 59 (Number of characters: 128):
These memories also viscerally informed me about the kind of relational love I had never
seen in my own or my friends’ families.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 60 (Number of characters: 362):
As I digested this experience over the years and used it
to overcome my denial about what I had missed out on as a child, I began the decades long quest
that has lead me to write this book as well as The Tao of Fully Feeling, which precedes it. The
Tao of Fully Feeling is a companion to this book and elaborates many of the foundational
principles of this book.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 61 (Number of characters: 132):
This book then is my hopeful effort to create a map that you can follow to heal the wounds
that come from not enough childhood love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 62 (Number of characters: 247):
If I am a bit repetitive at times about issues like
shrinking the critic and grieving the losses of childhood, it is my attempt to find different ways to
emphasize the great importance of engaging these themes of recovery work over and over again.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 63 (Number of characters: 124):
If you find yourself lost and not sure of how to get back onto the map, these themes will always
be key portals for reentry.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 64 (Number of characters: 115):
I sometimes recommend that readers view the table of contents and start with whatever headings
most strike a chord.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 65 (Number of characters: 784):
Although the book is laid out in a somewhat linear fashion, everyone’s
journey of recovering is different, and journeys can be initiated in a variety of ways. Journeys of recovering may begin when a death or great loss brings up an emotional storm
that opens up a hidden reservoir of childhood pain; or when a friend shares something about his
or her recovery process that strikes a chord; or when a book or TV show triggers a more serious
consideration of what really happened in childhood; or when something gets “opened up” in
couple’s therapy; or when a healing crisis in the form of panic attacks or a nervous breakdown
requires some outside help; or when the self-medicating strategies developed to soothe
depression and anxiety get out of control and also require outside help.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 66 (Number of characters: 252):
I hope that readers will be able to use this book as a textbook for recovering, and that
certain sections will call you back or forward to them repeatedly, as over time and with effective
work, certain themes continue to take on ever deepening meaning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 67 (Number of characters: 219):
In this vein, you will find that the Table of Contents is quite comprehensive, and sometimes
the best way to use this book is to browse through it and then read the sections and chapters that
most capture your interest.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 68 (Number of characters: 65):
Moreover, this is not a one size fits all formula for recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 69 (Number of characters: 143):
Depending on the specific
pattern of your childhood trauma, some of the advice contained herein may be less relevant or
even irrelevant to you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 70 (Number of characters: 75):
Please then focus on the material that seems applicable and helpful to
you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 71 (Number of characters: 272):
I also hope this map will guide you to heal in a way that helps you become an unflinching source
of kindness and self-compassion for yourself, and that out of that journey you will find at least
one other human being who will reciprocally love you well enough in that way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 72 (Number of characters: 66):
Finally I have illustrated this work with many real life examples.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 73 (Number of characters: 90):
All names and identifying
information have been changed to protect client confidentiality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 74 (Number of characters: 167):
PART 1
AN OVERVIEW OF RECOVERING

THE JOURNEY OF RECOVERING FROM CPTSD
I wrote this book from the perspective of someone who has Complex Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 75 (Number of characters: 78):
[Cptsd], and who has experienced a great reduction of symptoms over the years.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 76 (Number of characters: 141):
I also
wrote it from the viewpoint of someone who has discovered many silver linings in the long,
windy, bumpy road of recovering from Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 77 (Number of characters: 94):
I have also seen this type of recovering in a
number of my friends and many long term clients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 78 (Number of characters: 33):
First, the good news about Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 79 (Number of characters: 99):
It is a learned set of responses, and a failure to complete
numerous important developmental tasks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 80 (Number of characters: 63):
This means that it is environmentally, not genetically,
caused.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 81 (Number of characters: 109):
In other words, unlike most of the diagnoses it is confused with, it is neither inborn nor
characterological.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 82 (Number of characters: 23):
As such, it is learned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 83 (Number of characters: 32):
It is not inscribed in your DNA.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 84 (Number of characters: 34):
It is a disorder caused
by nurture

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 85 (Number of characters: 38):
[or rather the lack of it] not nature.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 86 (Number of characters: 85):
This is especially good news because what is learned can be unlearned and vice versa.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 87 (Number of characters: 81):
What
was not provided by your parents can now be provided by yourself and others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 88 (Number of characters: 80):
Recovery from Cptsd typically has important self-help and relational components.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 89 (Number of characters: 132):
The
relational piece can come from authors, friends, partners, teachers, therapists, therapeutic groups
or any combination of these.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 90 (Number of characters: 45):
I like to call this reparenting by committee.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 91 (Number of characters: 245):
I must emphasize, however, that some survivors of Cptsdengendering families were so
thoroughly betrayed by their parents, that it may be a long time, if ever, before they can trust
another human being enough to engage in relational healing work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 92 (Number of characters: 110):
When this is the case, pets,
books and online therapeutic websites can provide significant relational healing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 93 (Number of characters: 61):
This book describes a multimodal treatment approach to Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 94 (Number of characters: 139):
It is oriented toward the most
prevalent kind of Cptsd, the kind that comes from growing up in a severely abusive and/or
neglectful family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 95 (Number of characters: 282):
In this vein, the book describes a journey of healing the damage that occurs

when you suffer traumatizing abuse and abandonment. Traumatizing abuse and abandonment
can occur on verbal, emotional, spiritual, and/or physical levels. Moreover, sexual abuse is
especially traumatizing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 96 (Number of characters: 60):
I believe that we have an epidemic of traumatizing families.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 97 (Number of characters: 244):
Current estimates posit that one
in three girls and one in five boys are sexually abused before they enter adulthood, and recent
statistics from The Kim Foundation report that 26% of Americans over 18 have been diagnosed
with a mental disorder.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 98 (Number of characters: 100):
When abuse or neglect is severe enough, any one category of it can cause the child to
develop Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 99 (Number of characters: 110):
This is true even in the case of emotional neglect if both parents collude in it, as
we will see in chapter 5.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 100 (Number of characters: 90):
When abuse and neglect is multidimensional, the severity of the Cptsd
worsens accordingly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 101 (Number of characters: 89):
Definition Of Complex PTSD
Cptsd is a more severe form of Post-traumatic stress disorder.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 102 (Number of characters: 589):
It is delineated from this better
known trauma syndrome by five of its most common and troublesome features: emotional
flashbacks, toxic shame, self-abandonment, a vicious inner critic and social anxiety. Emotional flashbacks are perhaps the most noticeable and characteristic feature of Cptsd. Survivors of traumatizing abandonment are extremely susceptibility to painful emotional
flashbacks, which unlike ptsd do not typically have a visual component. Emotional flashbacks are sudden and often prolonged regressions to the overwhelming
feeling-states of being an abused/abandoned child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 103 (Number of characters: 98):
These feeling states can include
overwhelming fear, shame, alienation, rage, grief and depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 104 (Number of characters: 71):
They also include unnecessary
triggering of our fight/flight instincts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 105 (Number of characters: 163):
It is important to state here that emotional flashbacks, like most things in life, are not all-or-
none. Flashbacks can range in intensity from subtle to horrific.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 106 (Number of characters: 131):
They can also vary in duration
ranging from moments to weeks on end where they devolve into what many therapists call a
regression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 107 (Number of characters: 135):
Finally, a more clinical and extensive definition of Cptsd can be found on p. 121 of Judith
Herman’s seminal book, Trauma and Recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 108 (Number of characters: 192):
An Example Of An Emotional Flashback
As I write this I recall the first emotional flashback I was ever able to identify, although I did not
identify it until about ten years after it occurred.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 109 (Number of characters: 69):
At the time of the event, I was living with my
first serious partner.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 110 (Number of characters: 143):
The honeymoon phase of our relationship came to a screeching halt when
she unexpectedly started yelling at me for something I no longer recall.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 111 (Number of characters: 55):
What I do most vividly recall was how the yelling felt.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 112 (Number of characters: 31):
It felt like a fierce hot wind.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 113 (Number of characters: 111):
I felt
like I was being blown away – like my insides were being blown out, as a flame on a candle is
blown out.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 114 (Number of characters: 121):
Later, when I first heard about auras, I flashed back to this and felt like my aura had been
completely stripped from me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 115 (Number of characters: 136):
At the time itself, I also felt completely disoriented, unable to speak, respond or even think. I felt terrified, shaky and very little.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 116 (Number of characters: 124):
Somehow, I finally managed to totter to the door and get out

of the house where I eventually slowly pulled myself together.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 117 (Number of characters: 135):
As I said earlier, it took me ten years to figure out that this confusing and disturbing
phenomenon was an intense emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 118 (Number of characters: 77):
Some years later, I came to understand the
nature of this type of regression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 119 (Number of characters: 167):
I realized it was a flashback to the hundreds of times my
mother, in full homicidal visage, blasted me with her rage into terror, shame, dissociation and
helplessness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 120 (Number of characters: 330):
Emotional flashbacks are also accompanied by intense arousals of the fight/flight instinct, along
with hyperarousal of the sympathetic nervous system, the half of the nervous system that
controls arousal and activation. When fear is the dominant emotion in a flashback the person
feels extremely anxious, panicky or even suicidal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 121 (Number of characters: 305):
When despair predominates, a sense of
profound numbness, paralysis and desperation to hide may occur. A sense of feeling small, young, fragile, powerless and helpless is also commonly
experienced in an emotional flashback, and all symptoms are typically overlaid with humiliating
and crushing toxic shame.

Toxic Shame: The Veneer Of An Emotional Flashback
Toxic shame, explored enlighteningly by John Bradshaw in Healing The Shame That Binds,
obliterates a Cptsd survivor’s self-esteem with an overwhelming sense that he is loathsome, ugly,
stupid, or fatally flawed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 123 (Number of characters: 146):
Overwhelming self-disdain is typically a flashback to the way he felt
when suffering the contempt and visual skewering of his traumatizing parent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 124 (Number of characters: 75):
Toxic shame can
also be created by constant parental neglect and rejection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 125 (Number of characters: 158):
Early in my career I worked with David, a handsome, intelligent man who was a
professional actor. One day David came to see me after an unsuccessful audition.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 126 (Number of characters: 94):
Beside himself,
he burst out: “I never let on to anyone, but I know that I’m really very ugly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 127 (Number of characters: 79):
It is so stupid that
I’m trying to be an actor when I’m so painful to look at.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 128 (Number of characters: 160):
I will never forget how shocked and
disbelieving I felt at first, that such a handsome person could feel ugly, but further exploration
brought me understanding.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 129 (Number of characters: 72):
David’s childhood was characterized by broad spectrum abuse and neglect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 130 (Number of characters: 244):
He was the last
and unwanted child of a large family, and his alcoholic father repeatedly attacked and looked at
him with disgust. To make matters worse, his family imitated his father and frequently
humiliated him with heavy doses of contempt.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 131 (Number of characters: 103):
His older brother’s favorite gibe, accompanied by
a nauseated grimace, was “I can’t stand sight of you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 132 (Number of characters: 27):
You make me want to vomit!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 133 (Number of characters: 67):
Toxic shame can obliterate your self-esteem in the blink of an eye.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 134 (Number of characters: 150):
In an emotional flashback
you can regress instantly into feeling and thinking that you are as worthless and contemptible as
your family perceived you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 135 (Number of characters: 414):
When you are stranded in a flashback, toxic shame devolves into the
intensely painful alienation of the abandonment mélange - a roiling morass of shame, fear and
depression. The abandonment mélange is the fear and toxic shame that surrounds and interacts with the
abandonment depression. The abandonment depression itself is the deadened feeling of
helplessness and hopelessness that afflicts traumatized children.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 136 (Number of characters: 62):
Toxic shame also inhibits us from seeking comfort and support.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 137 (Number of characters: 165):
In a reenactment of the
childhood abandonment we are flashing back to, we often isolate ourselves and helplessly
surrender to an overwhelming feeling of humiliation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 138 (Number of characters: 117):
If you are stuck viewing yourself as worthless, defective, or despicable, you are probably in
an emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 139 (Number of characters: 87):
This is typically also true when you are lost in self-hate and virulent
self-criticism.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 140 (Number of characters: 280):
Immediate help for managing emotional flashbacks can be found at the beginning
of chapter 8 which lists 13 practical steps for resolving flashbacks. Numerous clients and respondents to my website tell me that the concept of emotional flashback
brings them a great sense of relief.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 141 (Number of characters: 93):
They report that for the first time they are able to make some
sense of their troubled lives.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 142 (Number of characters: 137):
A common comment has been “Now I understand why all the
psychological and spiritual approaches I have pursued had so few answers for me.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 143 (Number of characters: 118):
Many also
note feeling freed from a shaming list of misdiagnoses that have been given to them by
themselves or others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 144 (Number of characters: 141):
This in turn has aided them in ridding themselves of the self-destructive
habit of amassing evidence of their own defectiveness or craziness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 145 (Number of characters: 114):
Many also report a quantum
leap in their motivation to challenge the learned habits of self-hate and self-disgust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 146 (Number of characters: 72):
List Of Common Cptsd Symptoms
Survivors may not experience all of these.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 147 (Number of characters: 32):
Varying combinations are common.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 148 (Number of characters: 81):
Factors affecting
this are your 4F type and your childhood abuse/neglect pattern.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 149 (Number of characters: 259):
Emotional Flashbacks
Tyrannical Inner &/or Outer Critic
Toxic Shame
Self-Abandonment
Social anxiety
Abject feelings of loneliness and abandonment
Fragile Self-esteem
Attachment disorder
Developmental Arrests
Relationship difficulties
Radical mood vacillations

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 150 (Number of characters: 320):
[e.g., pseudo-cyclothymia: see chapter 12]
Dissociation via distracting activities or mental processes
Hair-triggered fight/flight response
Oversensitivity to stressful situations
Suicidal Ideation

Suicidal Ideation
Suicidal ideation is a common phenomenon in Cptsd, particularly during intense or prolonged
flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 151 (Number of characters: 304):
Suicidal ideation is depressed thinking or fantasizing about wanting to die. It can
range from active suicidality to passive suicidality. Passive suicidality is far more common with the Cptsd survivors who I have known, and it
ranges from wishing you were dead to fantasizing about ways to end your life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 152 (Number of characters: 153):
When lost in
suicidal ideation, the survivor may even pray to be delivered from this life, or fantasize about
being taken by some calamitous act of fate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 153 (Number of characters: 110):
He may even think or obsess - without being serious
- of stepping in front of a car or jumping off a building.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 154 (Number of characters: 75):
Fantasy typically ends, however, without a serious intent to kill yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 155 (Number of characters: 429):
This is as opposed
to active suicidality where the person is actively proceeding in the direction of taking her life. I am discussing passive suicidality because it does not merit the same kind of alarm as
active suicidality. Passive suicidality is typically a flashback to early childhood when our
abandonment was so profound, that it was natural for us to wish that God or somebody or
something would just put an end to it all.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 156 (Number of characters: 183):
When the survivor catches himself in a suicidal reverie, he will benefit from seeing it both
as an emblem of how much pain he is in, and as a sign of a particularly intense flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 157 (Number of characters: 76):
This
then can direct him to use the flashback management steps in chapter 8.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 158 (Number of characters: 298):
If however, flashback management does not help, and suicidality becomes increasingly
active, 
please 
call 
the 
national 
suicide 
hot-line [1-800-273-8255] 
or 
visit
www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org, because this is a flashback that you may need help
managing, and you will get good help there.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 159 (Number of characters: 166):
Skilled therapists and caregivers learn to discriminate between active and passive suicidal
ideation, and do not panic and catastrophize when encountering the latter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 160 (Number of characters: 428):
Instead, the counselor
invites the survivor to explore his suicidal thoughts and feelings knowing that in most cases,
verbal ventilation of the flashback pain underneath it will deconstruct the suicidality. In the much less common scenario of active suicidality, encouraging verbal ventilation will
also help the therapist or helper discern if there is indeed a real risk and if action needs to be
taken to protect the survivor.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 161 (Number of characters: 143):
What You May Have Been Misdiagnosed With
I once heard renowned traumatologist, John Briere, quip that if Cptsd were ever given its due,
the DSM

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 162 (Number of characters: 174):
[The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders] used by all mental health
professionals would shrink from its dictionary like size to the size of a thin pamphlet.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 163 (Number of characters: 101):
In other
words, the role of traumatized childhoods in most adult psychological disorders is enormous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 164 (Number of characters: 100):
I have witnessed many clients with Cptsd misdiagnosed with various anxiety and depressive
disorders.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 165 (Number of characters: 142):
Moreover, many are also unfairly and inaccurately labeled with bipolar, narcissistic,
codependent, autistic spectrum and borderline disorders.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 166 (Number of characters: 81):
[This is not to say that Cptsd does not
sometimes co-occur with these disorders.]

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 167 (Number of characters: 49):
Further confusion also arises in the case of ADHD

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 168 (Number of characters: 175):
[Attention Deficit Hyperactive
Disorder], as well as obsessive/compulsive disorder, both of which are sometimes more
accurately described as fixated flight responses to trauma

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 169 (Number of characters: 21):
[see the 4F’s below].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 170 (Number of characters: 25):
This is also true

of ADD

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 171 (Number of characters: 163):
[Attention Deficit Disorder] and some depressive and dissociative disorders which
similarly can more accurately be described as fixated freeze responses to trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 172 (Number of characters: 136):
Furthermore, this is not to say that those so misdiagnosed do not have issues that are similar
and correlative with the disorders above.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 173 (Number of characters: 137):
The key point is that these labels are incomplete and
unnecessarily shaming descriptions of what the survivor is actually afflicted with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 174 (Number of characters: 89):
Reducing Cptsd to “panic disorder” is like calling food allergies chronically itchy eyes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 175 (Number of characters: 286):
Over-focusing treatment on the symptoms of panic in the former case and eye health in the latter
does little to get at root causes. Feelings of panic or itchiness in the eyes can be masked with
medication, but all the associated problems that cause these symptoms will remain untreated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 176 (Number of characters: 228):
Moreover, most of the diagnoses mentioned above are typically treated as innate
characterological defects rather than as learned maladaptations to stress – adaptations that
survivors were forced to learn as traumatized children.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 177 (Number of characters: 179):
And, most importantly, because these
adaptations were learned, they can often be extinguished or significantly diminished, and
replaced with more functional adaptations to stress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 178 (Number of characters: 141):
In this vein, I believe that many substance and process addictions also begin as misguided,
maladaptations to parental abuse and abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 179 (Number of characters: 411):
They are early adaptations that are attempts
to soothe and distract from the mental, emotional and physical pain of Cptsd. Origins Of Cptsd
How do traumatically abused and/or abandoned children develop Cptsd? While the origin of Cptsd is most often associated with extended periods of physical and/or
sexual abuse in childhood, my observations convince me that ongoing verbal and emotional
abuse also causes it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 180 (Number of characters: 116):
Many dysfunctional parents react contemptuously to a baby or toddler’s plaintive call for
connection and attachment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 181 (Number of characters: 201):
Contempt is extremely traumatizing to a child, and at best, extremely
noxious to an adult. Contempt is a toxic cocktail of verbal and emotional abuse, a deadly amalgam of
denigration, rage and disgust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 182 (Number of characters: 148):
Rage creates fear, and disgust creates shame in the child in a way
that soon teaches her to refrain from crying out, from ever asking for attention.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 183 (Number of characters: 205):
Before long, the
child gives up on seeking any kind of help or connection at all. The child’s bid for bonding and
acceptance is thwarted, and she is left to suffer in the frightened despair of abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 184 (Number of characters: 104):
Particularly abusive parents deepen the abandonment trauma by linking corporal
punishment with contempt.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 185 (Number of characters: 102):
Slaveholders and prison guards typically use contempt and scorn to
destroy their victims’ self-esteem.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 186 (Number of characters: 169):
Slaves, prisoners, and children, who are made to feel
worthless and powerless devolve into learned helplessness and can be controlled with far less
energy and attention.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 187 (Number of characters: 148):
Cult leaders also use contempt to shrink their followers into absolute
submission after luring them in with brief phases of fake unconditional love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 188 (Number of characters: 65):
Furthermore, Cptsd can also be caused by emotional neglect alone.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 189 (Number of characters: 50):
This key theme is explored at
length in chapter 5.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 190 (Number of characters: 180):
If you notice that you are berating yourself because your trauma seems
insignificant compared to others, please skip ahead to this chapter and resume reading here upon

completion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 191 (Number of characters: 96):
Emotional neglect also typically underlies most traumatizations that are more glaringly
evident.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 192 (Number of characters: 270):
Parents who routinely ignore or turn their backs on a child’s calls for attention,
connection or help, abandon their child to unmanageable amounts of fear, and the child
eventually gives up and succumbs to depressed, death-like feelings of helplessness and
hopelessness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 193 (Number of characters: 110):
These types of rejection simultaneously magnify the child’s fear, and eventually add a
coating of shame to it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 194 (Number of characters: 226):
Over time this fear and shame begets a toxic inner critic that holds the
child, and later the adult, totally responsible for his parents’ abandonment, until he becomes his
own worst enemy and descends into the bowels of Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 195 (Number of characters: 164):
More About Trauma
Trauma occurs when attack or abandonment triggers a fight/flight response so intensely that the
person cannot turn it off once the threat is over.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 196 (Number of characters: 176):
He becomes stuck in an adrenalized state. His
sympathetic nervous system is locked “on” and he cannot toggle into the relaxation function of
the parasympathetic nervous system.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 197 (Number of characters: 93):
One common instance of this occurs when a child is attacked and hurt by a bully after
school.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 198 (Number of characters: 201):
He may remain in a hypervigilant, fearful state until someone takes action to insure him
that he will not be revictimized, and until someone helps him release the hyperactivation in his
nervous system.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 199 (Number of characters: 173):
If the child has learned through experience that he can come to at least one of his parents
when he is hurting, frightened or needing help, he will tell mom or dad about it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 200 (Number of characters: 188):
With them, he
will grieve the temporary death of his sense of safety in the world by verbally ventilating, crying
and angering about it [chapter 11 expands on these processes of grieving].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 201 (Number of characters: 156):
Moreover, his parent will report the bully and take steps to assure that it will not happen
again, and the child will typically be released from the trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 202 (Number of characters: 91):
He will naturally relax back into
the safety of parasympathetic nervous system functioning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 203 (Number of characters: 103):
“Simple”, one incident traumas can often be resolved relatively easily if Cptsd is not
already present.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 204 (Number of characters: 265):
If however the bullying happens on numerous occasions and the child does not seek help, or
if the child lives in an environment so dangerous that the parent is powerless to ensure a
modicum of safety, it may take more than parental comforting to release the trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 205 (Number of characters: 212):
If the
trauma is not too continuous over too long a time, a short course of therapy may be all that is
needed to resolve the trauma, provided of course the danger in the environment can effectively
be remediated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 206 (Number of characters: 168):
When the trauma however is repetitive and ongoing and no help is available, the child may
become so frozen in trauma that the symptoms of “simple” ptsd begin to set in.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 207 (Number of characters: 113):
This can also
occur during the prolonged trauma of combat or entrapment in a cult or domestic violence
situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 208 (Number of characters: 197):
If however, a person is also afflicted by ongoing family abuse or profound emotional
abandonment, the trauma will manifest as a particularly severe emotional flashback because he
already has Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 209 (Number of characters: 58):
This is particularly true when his parent is also a bully.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 210 (Number of characters: 13):
The Four F’s:

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 211 (Number of characters: 245):
Fight, Flight, Freeze And Fawn
Earlier, I mentioned the fight/flight response that is an innate automatic response to danger in all
human beings. A more complete and accurate description of this instinct is the
fight/flight/freeze/fawn response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 212 (Number of characters: 109):
The complex nervous system wiring of this response allows a
person in danger to react in four different ways.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 213 (Number of characters: 100):
A fight response is triggered when a person suddenly responds aggressively to something
threatening.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 214 (Number of characters: 137):
A flight response is triggered when a person responds to a perceived threat by
fleeing, or symbolically, by launching into hyperactivity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 215 (Number of characters: 181):
A freeze response is triggered when a
person, realizing resistance is futile, gives up, numbs out into dissociation and/or collapses as if
accepting the inevitability of being hurt.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 216 (Number of characters: 144):
A fawn response is triggered when a person responds to
threat by trying to be pleasing or helpful in order to appease and forestall an attacker.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 217 (Number of characters: 75):
This
fourfold response potential will heretofore be referred to as the 4Fs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 218 (Number of characters: 305):
Traumatized children often over-gravitate to one of these response patterns to survive, and
as time passes these four modes become elaborated into entrenched defensive structures that are
similar to narcissistic [fight], obsessive/compulsive [flight], dissociative [freeze] or codependent
[fawn] defenses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 219 (Number of characters: 133):
These structures help children survive their horrific childhoods, but leave them very limited
and narrow in how they respond to life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 220 (Number of characters: 138):
Even worse, they remain locked in these patterns in
adulthood when they no longer need to rely so heavily on one primary response pattern.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 221 (Number of characters: 183):
It is important to understand that variances in the childhood abuse/neglect patterns, birth
order, and genetic predispositions result in people polarizing to their particular 4F type.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 222 (Number of characters: 116):
In the next section we will explore examples of how children are driven into these defenses
by traumatizing parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 223 (Number of characters: 275):
The four children in the vignette below match the four basic types of
trauma survivors:
Bob=Fight - Narcissistic
Carol=Flight - Obsessive/Compulsive
Maude=Freeze - Dissociative
Sean=Fawn - Codependent
The 4F’s In A Cptsd-Inducing Family
Carol was the scapegoat of her family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 224 (Number of characters: 110):
Narcissistic and borderline parents typically choose at
least one child to be the designated family scapegoat.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 225 (Number of characters: 345):
Scapegoating is the process by which a bully offloads and externalizes his pain, stress, and
frustration by attacking a less powerful person. Typically scapegoating brings the bully some
momentary relief. It does not however effectively metabolize or release his pain, and
scapegoating soon resumes as the bully’s internal discomfort resurfaces.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 226 (Number of characters: 246):
Wilhelm Reich, in his brilliant book The Psychology of Fascism, explains how scapegoating
occurs on a continuum that stretches from the persecution of the targeted child by a bullying
parent to the horrific scapegoating of the Jews by the Nazi’s.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 227 (Number of characters: 147):
In especially dysfunctional families
like Carol’s, the scapegoating parent often organizes the rest of the family to also gang up on the
scapegoat.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 228 (Number of characters: 232):
Carol discovered a great deal about her early childhood from watching home videos. Her
parents were so narcissistically oblivious, that they unabashedly recorded many incidents of
Carol being verbally and emotionally abused by them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 229 (Number of characters: 112):
This was usually in the background of
recordings of the performances of their favorite child, her older brother.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 230 (Number of characters: 82):
Severely narcissistic
parents are rarely embarrassed by their aggressive behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 231 (Number of characters: 140):
They feel entitled to punish a child
for anything that displeases them, no matter how unreasonable it might appear to an impartial
observer.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 232 (Number of characters: 115):
Carols’ parents started in on her early by disdainfully blaming her for soiling her diaper
before she was even one.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 233 (Number of characters: 201):
By the time she was three, she had been so frequently punished for
making noise while talking and playfully exploring her house, that her constant state of fear
generated an ADHD-like condition in her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 234 (Number of characters: 210):
Carol’s large backyard was her refuge where she would play with great gusto - climbing,
running, cavorting, and building and ransacking villages that she made with her toys and leaves,
grass, sticks and stones.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 235 (Number of characters: 192):
She would busy herself from breakfast until supper, often forgetting to
come in for lunch, which she thought in retrospect made life even easier for her mother, who
never called her in to eat.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 236 (Number of characters: 120):
One family video from this time was the straw that broke the camel’s back of Carol’s denial
that her family was abusive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 237 (Number of characters: 187):
It showed her playing a game whereby she would repetitively smack
herself hard on the hand and call herself a bad girl as she wobbled around the living room
touching various knick-knacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 238 (Number of characters: 127):
There was a considerable amount of footage that showed her
parents and siblings roaring with mocking delight in the background.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 239 (Number of characters: 110):
When contempt replaces the milk of human kindness at an early age, the child feels
humiliated and overwhelmed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 240 (Number of characters: 155):
Too helpless to protest or even understand the unfairness of being
abused, the child eventually becomes convinced that she is defective and fatally flawed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 241 (Number of characters: 75):
Frequently she comes to believe that she deserves her parents’ persecution.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 242 (Number of characters: 74):
When Carol was four, she “accidentally” fell out of a second story window.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 243 (Number of characters: 99):
A few years
later, she stepped out into the street in front of a car and was knocked to the ground.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 244 (Number of characters: 110):
As an adult,
she was convinced that both injuries contributed to her extremely painful, early onset scoliosis.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 245 (Number of characters: 98):
She also believed that she was in so much pain, that she was unconsciously trying to end her life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 246 (Number of characters: 71):
Fortunately for Carol, school eventually offered a glimmer of reprieve.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 247 (Number of characters: 122):
A kindly third grade
teacher perceived her intelligence, and praised her enough that she soon became an excellent
student.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 248 (Number of characters: 127):
Unfortunately, the terrible anxiety that she lived with 24/7 soon morphed into an
obsessive/compulsive approach to school work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 249 (Number of characters: 83):
This, in turn, later manifested into a life-spoiling
perfectionism and workaholism.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 250 (Number of characters: 115):
Carol’s older brother, Bob, the favorite and hero of her parents was not molded with fear
and rejection like Carol.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 251 (Number of characters: 173):
Bob, the recipient of the parents’ narcissistic expectations, was shaped
into a multidimensional achiever by their withdrawal of approval for less than perfect
performances.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 252 (Number of characters: 113):
He was then given tidbits of praise for outstanding accomplishments that would
reflect positively on his parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 253 (Number of characters: 106):
He was also enlisted to further scapegoat Carol, and as time
went on outdid his parents in tormenting her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 254 (Number of characters: 282):
I believe there is an epidemic of sibling abuse that afflicts many dysfunctional families. Siblings in such families can traumatize the victim-scapegoat as severely as the parents. In
families with checked out, disinterested parents, they can in fact be the chief sources of trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 255 (Number of characters: 167):
This is especially true in our culture where emotional neglect of children is rampant and where
parents are routinely advised to let the kids “work it out themselves.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 256 (Number of characters: 150):
But how does a child who

has half the strength of his older sibling work it out, and stop him from tormenting her without
the aid of a stronger ally?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 257 (Number of characters: 71):
Bob, himself, did not escape the pathological influence of his parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 258 (Number of characters: 161):
Scapegoating became
a habit for him, and he developed the narcissist’s sixth sense for identifying others whose
families had victimized and used them as targets.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 259 (Number of characters: 150):
Bob, hurting from his parents using him and
holding him to perfectionistic standards, grew up to become a full-fledged narcissist and
“control-freak”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 260 (Number of characters: 156):
He aggressively tried to mold his “loved” ones as he had been molded, and was
working on whipping his fourth wife into shape at the time of Carol’s therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 261 (Number of characters: 23):
Let us return to Carol.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 262 (Number of characters: 470):
As an adolescent, her trauma was painfully reinforced by her
surrounding community who so admired her brother’s accomplishments, that they joined the
family in pathologizing Carol as a “bad seed”. Unfortunately things deteriorated further for Carol as an adult, even though she had
seemingly escaped from the family. Carol remained symbolically enthralled to the family by
getting ensnared with narcissistic people who were just as abusive and neglectful as her parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 263 (Number of characters: 142):
This well known psychological phenomenon is called repetition compulsion or reenactment, and
trauma survivors are extremely susceptible to it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 264 (Number of characters: 53):
We will explore this extensively throughout the
book.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 265 (Number of characters: 53):
A third child, Maude, was born two years after Carol.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 266 (Number of characters: 171):
By this time, her parents were worn
out from incessantly molding Bob and Carol. Having whipped Bob and Carol into hero- and
scapegoat-shape, they had little use for Maude.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 267 (Number of characters: 75):
They did not have enough energy or interest left
to whip her into anything.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 268 (Number of characters: 77):
Maude became the classic lost child and was left on her own to raise herself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 269 (Number of characters: 72):
She soon
discovered food and daydreaming as her sole sources of comfort.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 270 (Number of characters: 108):
However, because Bob also
enjoyed using her for target practice, she stayed in her room as much as possible.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 271 (Number of characters: 63):
In retrospect, Carol also thought that Bob was molesting Maude.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 272 (Number of characters: 412):
She hypothesized that
these two factors contributed to the fact that Maude could not tolerate the various nurseries and
pre-schools in which her mother tried to dump her. Over time, Maude numbed out into a low
grade dissociative depression, and felt extremely anxious and avoidant whenever she was in a
social situation. At four, an eccentric aunt gave Maude a television for her room and she was soon
entranced.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 273 (Number of characters: 108):
She was forced to develop an attachment disorder in which she bonded with TV rather
than with a human being.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 274 (Number of characters: 145):
Sadly, she is still lost in that relationship living on disability in an
apartment cluttered with an enormous amount of useless hoarded material.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 275 (Number of characters: 230):
Poor Parenting Creates Pathological Sibling Rivalry
Like many children in Cptsd-engendering families, Maude could not turn to her siblings for
comfort because her parents unconsciously practiced the “divide and conquer” principle.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 276 (Number of characters: 89):
Her
parents modeled and encouraged sarcasm and constant fault finding among the children.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 277 (Number of characters: 73):
Moreover, interactions of cooperation or warmth were routinely ridiculed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 278 (Number of characters: 290):
Sibling rivalry is further reinforced in dysfunctional families by the fact that all the children
are subsisting on minimal nurturance, and are therefore without resources to give to each other. Moreover, competition for the little their parents have to give creates even fiercer rivalries.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 279 (Number of characters: 31):
Two years later, Sean was born.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 280 (Number of characters: 212):
At first, it seemed as if he was destined for the same lost,

dissociated destiny as Maude, but as he matured he fell into the role of “gifted child” as
described by Alice Miller in The Drama of the Gifted Child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 281 (Number of characters: 175):
Sean’s inborn gift coming into this life was his compassion and his sense that if he studied
his mother enough and figured out what she needed, he could provide for her needs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 282 (Number of characters: 85):
This would
sometimes calm her down and make her less dangerous, bitter and sarcastic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 283 (Number of characters: 117):
Over the years Sean honed this skill and could almost clairvoyantly anticipate her sore
spots, moods and preferences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 284 (Number of characters: 167):
Sometimes it seemed he knew what she needed before she did,
and with practice he became adept at defusing her anger and sometimes even gaining morsels of
her approval.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 285 (Number of characters: 121):
Synchronistically, his mother realized she was getting old and that her alcohol-ravaged
husband would likely precede her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 286 (Number of characters: 133):
Not wanting to be alone, she exploited his compassionate
nature and primed him for domestic service for as long as she would need it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 287 (Number of characters: 118):
Sean remained
living at home until his mother’s death released him from emotional captivity at the age of
twenty-nine.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 288 (Number of characters: 71):
This was the codependent enslavement we will explore more in chapter 7.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 289 (Number of characters: 113):
A friend of Sean’s who knew all the siblings as adults, marveled that it seemed as if each
had different parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 290 (Number of characters: 128):
Finally, it is also important to note that the scapegoat role does not fall exclusively on the
flight type as it did with Carol.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 291 (Number of characters: 75):
It can be bestowed on anyone of the 4F types depending on the
given family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 292 (Number of characters: 134):
The scapegoating role can also shift over time from one person to another and each
parent or sibling may choose a different scapegoat.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 293 (Number of characters: 105):
Chapters 6 and 7 explore each of the 4F’s and their corresponding defensive structures in
greater detail.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 294 (Number of characters: 210):
These chapters will also help you determine your key 4F defense, and help you
address issues that are more specific to your type of Cptsd.

LEVELS OF RECOVERING
Healing from Complex PTSD is, above all, complex.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 295 (Number of characters: 129):
This is important to emphasize because
there are numerous one dimensional approaches to trauma that bill themselves as cure-alls.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 296 (Number of characters: 121):
In my
opinion, however, singular approaches are unable to address all the levels of wounding that
combine to cause Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 297 (Number of characters: 126):
Moreover, working with simplistic approaches can leave you stranded in toxic shame when
you do not achieve the touted results.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 298 (Number of characters: 163):
I was motivated to write this book in large part because of
the many times I sank into new levels of self-contempt when the latest panacea therapy did not
cure me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 299 (Number of characters: 96):
I will use the word “key” repeatedly to describe the various tasks upon which recovering
hinges.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 300 (Number of characters: 140):
This book offers a keychain of perspectives and techniques to unlock yourself from being
what Alice Miller called a “Prisoner of Childhood.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 301 (Number of characters: 130):
Abusive and abandoning parents can injure and abandon us on many levels: cognitive,
emotional, spiritual, physical and relational.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 302 (Number of characters: 165):
To recover, you need to learn how to support
yourself – to meet your unmet developmental needs on each level that is relevant to your
experience of childhood trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 303 (Number of characters: 78):
This chapter is a brief overview of the many tasks involved in Cptsd recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 304 (Number of characters: 54):
These tasks
are explored at greater length in Part II.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 305 (Number of characters: 264):
The comprehensive Table of Contents at the beginning
of this book will direct you to further information on each of the topics covered in this chapter. Please allow yourself to also use the Table of Contents to explore sections of the book that peak
your interest.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 306 (Number of characters: 127):
Key Developmental Arrests In Cptsd
What follows is a list of some of the most common developmental arrests that occur in Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 307 (Number of characters: 105):
You may find that you experience a diminishment or absence of these key features of healthy

human being.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 308 (Number of characters: 85):
Typically, survivors will vary on which and how many of these arrests relate to
them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 309 (Number of characters: 156):
Factors affecting this are your 4F type, your childhood abuse/ neglect pattern, your innate
nature and any recovery work that you have already accomplished.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 310 (Number of characters: 406):
Self-acceptance
Clear sense of identity
Self-Compassion
Self-Protection
Capacity to draw comfort from relationship
Ability to relax
Capacity for full self-expression
Willpower & Motivation
Peace of mind
Self-care
Belief that life is a gift
Self-esteem
Self-confidence
My efforts to nurture myself in these arrested areas of development were limited and spoiled in
early recovery by a feeling of resentment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 311 (Number of characters: 58):
“Why do I have to do this?” was a common internal
refrain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 312 (Number of characters: 140):
Resentment that should have been directed toward my parents often boomeranged onto
me and spoiled or thwarted my efforts at self-nurturance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 313 (Number of characters: 63):
Thankfully ongoing recovery work helped remedy this resentment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 314 (Number of characters: 112):
It taught me to practice
self-care in a spirit of giving to a child who needed and really deserved to be helped.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 315 (Number of characters: 162):
I find it helpful to approach developmental arrests from the viewpoint of novelist David
Mitchell’s quip that “…fire is the sun unwinding itself out of the wood”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 316 (Number of characters: 108):
Similarly, effective
recovery is unwinding the natural potential you were born with out of your unconscious.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 317 (Number of characters: 96):
This is
your innate potential which may be, as yet, unrealized because of your childhood trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 318 (Number of characters: 216):
An especially tragic developmental arrest that afflicts many survivors is the loss of their
will power and self-motivation. Many dysfunctional parents react destructively to their child’s
budding sense of initiative.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 319 (Number of characters: 96):
If this occurs throughout his childhood, the survivor may feel lost
and purposeless in his life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 320 (Number of characters: 67):
He may drift through his whole life rudderless and without a motor.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 321 (Number of characters: 143):
Moreover, even when he manages to identify a goal of his own choosing, he may struggle
to follow through with extended and concentrated effort.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 322 (Number of characters: 245):
Remedying this developmental arrest is
essential because many new psychological studies now show that persistence – even more than
intelligence or innate talent - is the key psychological characteristic necessary for finding
fulfillment in life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 323 (Number of characters: 78):
I have worked with many survivors stranded in this form of adult helplessness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 324 (Number of characters: 138):
Those who
recover from it typically do so by engaging extensively in the angering work of grieving that is
discussed throughout this book.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 325 (Number of characters: 99):
The ability to invoke willpower seems to be allied to your ability
to healthily express your anger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 326 (Number of characters: 72):
With sufficient recovering, you can learn to manufacture your

volition.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 327 (Number of characters: 51):
In the beginning you can fake it until you make it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 328 (Number of characters: 123):
This is what Stephen Johnson calls
“the hard work miracle.”
What follows is a concluding comment about development arrests.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 329 (Number of characters: 51):
Some survivors have
confidence but not self-esteem.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 330 (Number of characters: 122):
In childhood, my own flight response got channeled into
acquiring academic skills for which the outside world rewarded me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 331 (Number of characters: 123):
But the benefit of these
rewards never penetrated my toxic shame enough to allow me to feel that I was a worthwhile
person.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 332 (Number of characters: 110):
My critic, like my parents, always found something flawed in me to contradict the feedback
that I was getting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 333 (Number of characters: 58):
Ninety-nine percent on a test was never a cause for pride.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 334 (Number of characters: 92):
Rather, it was the
impetus for a great deal of self-criticism about the missing one percent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 335 (Number of characters: 87):
Like many other
survivors that I have worked with, I developed the imposter’s syndrome.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 336 (Number of characters: 78):
This syndrome
contradicted the outside positive feedback that I was receiving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 337 (Number of characters: 77):
It insisted that if people really
knew me, they would see what a loser I was.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 338 (Number of characters: 104):
Eventually, however, I became confident in my
intelligence even though my self-esteem was still abysmal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 339 (Number of characters: 209):
COGNITIVE HEALING
The first level of recovery usually involves repairing the damage that Cptsd wreaks on our
thoughts and beliefs about ourselves. Cognitive recovery work aims to make your brain user friendly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 340 (Number of characters: 131):
It focuses on recognizing
and eliminating the destructive thoughts and thinking processes you were indoctrinated with in
childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 341 (Number of characters: 126):
Cognitive healing also depends on learning to choose healthy and more accurate ways of
talking to and thinking about yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 342 (Number of characters: 91):
On the broadest level, this involves upgrading the story
you tell yourself about your pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 343 (Number of characters: 111):
We need to understand exactly how appalling parenting created the now self-perpetuating
trauma that we live in.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 344 (Number of characters: 93):
We can learn to do this in a way that takes the mountain of unfair self-
blame off ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 345 (Number of characters: 76):
We can redirect this blame to our parents’ dreadful child-rearing practices.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 346 (Number of characters: 137):
And we can also do this in a way that motivates us to reject their influence so that we can freely
orchestrate our journey of recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 347 (Number of characters: 69):
This work then requires us to build a fierce allegiance to ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 348 (Number of characters: 141):
Such loyalty strengthens
us for the cognitive work of freeing our brains from being conditioned to attack so many normal
parts of our selves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 349 (Number of characters: 124):
Cognitive work is fundamental to helping you disidentify from the self-hating critic with
which your parents inculcated you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 350 (Number of characters: 144):
As I am writing this, my son’s friend synchronistically tells
him: “This Lego creature I made spreads brain attack and eats away at the person.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 351 (Number of characters: 96):
I marvel at
this synchronicity and think: “What a fitting image for the trauma-inducing parent”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 352 (Number of characters: 218):
Shrinking The Critic
Early abuse and abandonment forces the child to merge his identity with the superego, the part of

the child’s brain that learns the rules of his caretakers in order to get and maintain acceptance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 353 (Number of characters: 142):
However, because acceptance is impossible in the Cptsd-engendering family, the superego gets
stuck working overtime to achieve the impossible.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 354 (Number of characters: 171):
Perseverating on finding a formula to win
over her parents, the child eventually embraces perfectionism as a strategy to make her parents
less dangerous and more engaging.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 355 (Number of characters: 119):
Her one hope is that if she becomes smart, helpful, pretty,
and flawless enough, her parents will finally care for her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 356 (Number of characters: 99):
Sadly, continued failure at winning their regard forces her to conclude that she is fatally
flawed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 357 (Number of characters: 74):
She is loveless not because of her mistakes, but because she is a mistake.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 358 (Number of characters: 54):
She can only
see what is wrong with or missing in her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 359 (Number of characters: 135):
Anything she does, says, thinks, imagines or feels has the potential to spiral her down into a
depressed abyss of fear and toxic shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 360 (Number of characters: 64):
Her superego fledges into a full-blown, trauma-
inducing critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 361 (Number of characters: 96):
Self-criticism, then, runs non-stop in a desperate attempt to avoid rejection-inducing
mistakes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 362 (Number of characters: 104):
Drasticizing becomes obsessive to help the child foresee and avoid punishment and
worsening abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 363 (Number of characters: 90):
At the same time, it continuously fills her psyche with stories and
images of catastrophe.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 364 (Number of characters: 83):
The survivor becomes imprisoned by a jailer who will accept nothing but perfection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 365 (Number of characters: 95):
He is
chauffeured by a hysterical driver who sees nothing but danger in every turn of the road.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 366 (Number of characters: 81):
Chapters 9 and 10 focus extensively on practical tools for shrinking your critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 367 (Number of characters: 124):
The Developmentally Arrested Healthy Ego
Over time the critic becomes more and more synonymous with the survivor’s identity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 368 (Number of characters: 92):
The
superego morphs into a totalitarian critic that trumps the development of a healthy ego.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 369 (Number of characters: 209):
[The ego
develops later than the superego.]
“Ego”, contrary to popular usage, is not a dirty word. In psychology, the term ego
represents what we typically mean when we use terms like my “self” or my identity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 370 (Number of characters: 59):
The healthy
ego is the user friendly manager of the psyche.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 371 (Number of characters: 169):
Unfortunately, Cptsd-inducing parents thwart the
growth of the ego by undermining the development of the crucial egoic processes of self-
compassion and self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 372 (Number of characters: 136):
They do this by shaming or intimidating you whenever you have a natural impulse to have
sympathy for yourself, or stand up for yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 373 (Number of characters: 110):
The instinct to care for yourself and to protect
yourself against unfairness is then forced to become dormant.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 374 (Number of characters: 175):
Psychoeducation And Cognitive Healing
Becoming psychoeducated about Cptsd is the first level of addressing this poisonous
indoctrination of your mind against your healthy ego.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 375 (Number of characters: 188):
When you intricately understand how
antagonistic your parents were to your healthy sense of self, you become more motivated to
engage in the self-help processes of rectifying their damage.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 376 (Number of characters: 43):
The more you identify their damage
the more

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 377 (Number of characters: 21):
you know what to fix.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 378 (Number of characters: 122):
This is essential because without a properly functioning ego, you have no center for making
healthy choices and decisions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 379 (Number of characters: 190):
All too often, your decisions are based on the fear of getting in
trouble or getting abandoned, rather than on the principles of having meaningful and equitable

interactions with the world.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 380 (Number of characters: 170):
You can learn to gradually replace the critic’s toxic perspective with a viewpoint that
supports you in your life, and that stops you from unnecessarily scaring yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 381 (Number of characters: 98):
You are free now as an adult to develop peace of mind and a supportive relationship with
yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 382 (Number of characters: 114):
A self-championing stance can transform your existence from struggling survival to a
fulfilling sense of thriving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 383 (Number of characters: 123):
You can begin right now by inviting your instincts of self-compassion and self-protection to
awaken and bloom in your life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 384 (Number of characters: 86):
Cognitive healing may have begun or been reinforced by reading what has preceded this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 385 (Number of characters: 85):
Hopefully you are having some epiphanies about what is at the core of your suffering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 386 (Number of characters: 165):
Some readers may have been searching for cognitive answers for years, and through their
reading and therapy already created a sizable foundation for doing this work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 387 (Number of characters: 176):
At the same time, those who have only tried a Cognitive-Behavioral Approach [CBT] to
healing their trauma may feel great resistance to hearing that cognitive work is important.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 388 (Number of characters: 107):
If you
are like me, you may have been introduced to it in a way that promised more than could be
delivered.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 389 (Number of characters: 118):
Cognitive tools are irreplaceable in healing cognitive issues, but they do not address
all the levels of our wounding.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 390 (Number of characters: 81):
They are especially limited in addressing emotional issues, as we
will see below.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 391 (Number of characters: 198):
In early recovery, the psychoeducation piece of cognitive work typically comes from the wisdom
of others: teachers, writers, friends and therapists who are more informed on this subject than we
are.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 392 (Number of characters: 116):
When psychoeducation reaches its most powerful level of effectiveness, however, it begins
to morph into mindfulness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 393 (Number of characters: 190):
MINDFULNESS
Psychologically speaking, mindfulness is taking undistracted time to become fully aware of your
thoughts and feelings so that you can have more choice in how you respond to them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 394 (Number of characters: 80):
Do I really
agree with this thought, or have I been pressured into believing it?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 395 (Number of characters: 144):
How do I want to respond to
this feeling – distract myself from it, repress it, express it or just feel it until it changes into
something else?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 396 (Number of characters: 112):
Mindfulness is a perspective that weds your capacity for self-observation with your instinct
of self-compassion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 397 (Number of characters: 219):
It is therefore your ability to observe yourself from an objective and self-
accepting viewpoint. It is a key function of a healthily developed ego and is sometimes described
as the observing ego or the witnessing self.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 398 (Number of characters: 84):
Mindfulness is a perspective of benign curiosity about all of your inner experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 399 (Number of characters: 86):
Recovery is enhanced immeasurably by developing this helpful process of introspection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 400 (Number of characters: 160):
As it
becomes more developed, mindfulness can be used to recognize and dis-identify from beliefs and
viewpoints that you acquired from your traumatizing family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 401 (Number of characters: 82):
I cannot overstate the importance of becoming aware of your inner self-commentary.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 402 (Number of characters: 185):
With
enough practice, mindfulness eventually awakens your fighting spirit to resist the abusive
refrains from your childhood, and to replace them with thoughts that are self-supportive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 403 (Number of characters: 121):
Mindfulness also helps you to establish a perspective from which you can assess and guide your
own efforts of recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 404 (Number of characters: 461):
Chapter 12 contains detailed instruction for enhancing mindfulness, as do the writings of
Steven Levine, Jack Kornfield and John Kabat-Zinn. Finally, it is important to note that mindfulness tends to develop and expand in a progressive
manner to all levels of our experience, cognitive, emotional, physical and relational. Mindfulness
is essential for guiding us at every level of recovering, and we will examine this principle more
closely throughout the book.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 405 (Number of characters: 119):
EMOTIONAL HEALING
Traumatizing parents do as much damage to our emotional natures as they do to our thinking
processes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 406 (Number of characters: 89):
Consequently, there is a great deal of recovery work that needs to be done on this
level.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 407 (Number of characters: 99):
This is especially true because of the damage our wider society also does to our emotional
natures.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 408 (Number of characters: 97):
Recovering The Emotional Nature
This section is an updated version of an article I wrote in 1991.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 409 (Number of characters: 201):
I originally wrote it as a prelude
to my first book, The Tao of Fully Feeling, and it was written as an appeal to the general public
to understand the consequences of trying to sanitize one’s emotions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 410 (Number of characters: 176):
Thankfully, the response I
received encouraged me to complete that book, which is a guide to overcoming the familial and
societal damage meted out on children’s emotional life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 411 (Number of characters: 251):
The survivor, who is seeking a healthy relationship with his emotional being, will strive to
accept the existential fact that the human feeling nature is often contradictory and frequently
vacillates between opposite polarities of feeling experiences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 412 (Number of characters: 128):
It is quite normal for feelings to
change unpredictably along continuums that stretch between a variety of emotional polarities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 413 (Number of characters: 218):
As
such, it is especially human and healthy to have shifts of mood between such extremes as happy
and sad, enthused and depressed, loving and angry, trusting and suspicious, brave and afraid, and
forgiving and blaming.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 414 (Number of characters: 111):
Unfortunately, in this culture only the “positive” polarity of any emotional experience is
approved or allowed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 415 (Number of characters: 115):
This can cause such an avoidance of the “negative” polarity, that at least
two different painful conditions result.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 416 (Number of characters: 145):
In the first, the person injures and exhausts himself in compulsive attempts to avoid a
disavowed feeling, and actually becomes more stuck in it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 417 (Number of characters: 141):
This is like the archetypal clown
whose frantic efforts to free himself from a piece of fly paper, leave him more immobilized and

entangled.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 418 (Number of characters: 160):
In the second, repression of one end of the emotional continuum often leads to a repression
of the whole continuum, and the person becomes emotionally deadened.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 419 (Number of characters: 93):
The baby of emotional
vitality is thrown out with the bathwater of some unacceptable feeling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 420 (Number of characters: 113):
A reluctance to participate in such a fundamental realm of the human experience results in
much unnecessary loss.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 421 (Number of characters: 218):
For just as without night there is no day, without work there is no play,
without hunger there is no satiation, without fear there is no courage, without tears there is no
joy, and without anger, there is no real love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 422 (Number of characters: 213):
Most people, who choose or are coerced into only identifying with “positive” feelings,
usually wind up in an emotionally lifeless middle ground – bland, deadened, and dissociated in
an unemotional “no-man’s-land.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 423 (Number of characters: 174):
Moreover, when a person tries to hold onto a preferred feeling for longer than its actual
tenure, she often appears as unnatural and phony as ersatz grass or plastic flowers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 424 (Number of characters: 232):
If instead, she
learns to surrender willingly to the normal human experience that good feelings always ebb and
flow, she will eventually be graced with a growing ability to renew herself in the vital waters of
emotional flexibility.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 425 (Number of characters: 161):
The repression of the so-called negative polarities of emotion causes much unnecessary
pain, as well as the loss of many essential aspects of the feeling nature.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 426 (Number of characters: 258):
In fact, much of the
plethora of loneliness, alienation, and addictive distraction that plagues modern industrial
societies is a result of people being taught and forced to reject, pathologize or punish so many of
their own and others’ normal feeling states.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 427 (Number of characters: 181):
Nowhere, not in the deepest recesses of the self, or in the presence of his closest friends, is
the average person allowed to have and explore any number of normal emotional states.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 428 (Number of characters: 122):
Anger,
depression, envy, sadness, fear, distrust, etc., are all as normal a part of life as bread and flowers
and streets.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 429 (Number of characters: 74):
Yet, they have become ubiquitously avoided and shameful human experiences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 430 (Number of characters: 124):
How tragic this is, for all of these emotions have enormously important and healthy
functions in a wholly integrated psyche.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 431 (Number of characters: 81):
One dimension where this is most true is in the arena of
healthy self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 432 (Number of characters: 428):
For without access to our uncomfortable or painful feelings, we are
deprived of the most fundamental part of our ability to notice when something is unfair, abusive,
or neglectful in our environments. Those who cannot feel their sadness often do not know when they are being unfairly
excluded, and those who cannot feel their normal angry or fearful responses to abuse, are often in
danger of putting up with it without protest.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 433 (Number of characters: 133):
Perhaps never before has humankind been so alienated from so many of its normal feeling
states, as it is in the twenty-first century.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 434 (Number of characters: 85):
Never before have so many human beings been so
emotionally deadened and impoverished.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 435 (Number of characters: 48):
The disease of emotional emaciation is epidemic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 436 (Number of characters: 160):
Its effects on health are often
euphemistically labeled as stress, and like the emotions, stress is often treated like some
unwanted waste that must be removed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 437 (Number of characters: 231):
Until all of the emotions are accepted indiscriminately (and acceptance does not imply
license to dump emotions irresponsibly or abusively), there can be no wholeness, no real sense of
well being, and no solid sense of self esteem.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 438 (Number of characters: 375):
Thus, while it may be fairly easy to like yourself
when feelings of love or happiness or serenity are present, deeper psychological health is seen
only when you can maintain a posture of self-love and self-respect in the times of emotional hurt
that accompany life’s inevitable contingencies of loss, loneliness, confusion, uncontrollable

unfairness, and accidental mistake.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 439 (Number of characters: 87):
The human feeling experience, much like the weather, is often unpredictably changeable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 440 (Number of characters: 128):
No “positive” feeling can be induced to persist as a permanent experience, no matter what
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy tells us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 441 (Number of characters: 328):
As disappointing as this may be, as much as we might
like to deny it, as much as it causes each of us ongoing life frustration, and as much as we were
raised and continue to be reinforced for trying to control and pick our feelings, they are still by
definition of the human condition, largely outside the province of our wills.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 442 (Number of characters: 430):
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE
Daniel Goleman defines emotional intelligence as our ability to successfully recognize and
manage our own feelings and to healthily respond to the feelings of others. As implied above, I
believe the quality of our emotional intelligence is reflected in the degree to which we accept all
of our feelings without automatically dissociating from them or expressing them in a way that
hurts ourselves or others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 443 (Number of characters: 84):
When we are emotionally intelligent we also extend this acceptance to
our intimates.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 444 (Number of characters: 193):
One of my clients calls this the hallmark of “relationships.”
Another way of saying this is that I have self-esteem to the degree that I keep my heart open
to myself in all my emotional states.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 445 (Number of characters: 96):
And, I have intimacy when my friend and I offer this type
of emotional acceptance to each other.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 446 (Number of characters: 129):
Once again, this does not condone destructive expressions
of anger which are, of course, counterproductive to trust and intimacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 447 (Number of characters: 457):
Cptsd-engendering parents often hypocritically attack their children’s emotional expression in a
bi-modal way. This occurs when the child is both abused for emoting and is, at the same time,
abused by her caretaker’s toxic emotional expression. Most traumatizing parents are especially contemptuous towards the child’s expression of
emotional pain. This contempt then forces the child’s all-important capacity for healthy grieving
into developmental arrest.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 448 (Number of characters: 345):
One archetypal example of this is seen in the parent who hurts his child to the point of tears,
and then has the nerve to say: “Stop crying or I’ll give you something to cry about!” A client
once told me that he often fantasized about giving his father this angry reply: “What are you
talking about, you already gave me something to cry about?!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 449 (Number of characters: 145):
He did not, however, because he
had long since learned that getting angry back was a capital crime that would elicit the most
savage retaliation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 450 (Number of characters: 96):
Typically it would be delivered with homicidal rage: “I’ll knock you from
here to Kingdom come!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 451 (Number of characters: 85):
The above is of course a blatant example of the slaughtering of emotional expression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 452 (Number of characters: 147):
Just
as common is the insidious, passive-aggressive assault on emoting which is seen in the parent
who shuns her child for expressing his feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 453 (Number of characters: 158):
This is seen in the emotionally abandoning
parent who sequesters the child in a timeout for crying, or routinely retreats from the crying child
into her room.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 454 (Number of characters: 102):
The worst, most damaging example of this occurs when this is done to the pre-verbal
toddler [or baby!]

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 455 (Number of characters: 52):
who only has emotions with which to express herself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 456 (Number of characters: 153):
Pre-verbal children are
by definition far too young to learn the 2-3 year-olds’ developmental task of using her words to

communicate about her feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 457 (Number of characters: 521):
An especially nasty form of emotional abuse occurs in the traumatizing family when the child is
even attacked for displays of pleasant emotion. As I write this I flashback to scenes of my mother
sneering at my little sister and snarling: “What are you so happy about!”, and my father’s
frequent: “What are you laughing at – wipe that smile off your face!”
Emotional abuse is also almost always also accompanied by emotional abandonment, which can
most simply be described as a relentless lack of parental warmth and love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 458 (Number of characters: 222):
Sometimes this is
most poignantly described as not being liked by your parents, which belies the many Cptsd-
inducing parents who say they love their children, but demonstrate in a thousand ways that they
do not like them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 459 (Number of characters: 90):
“The sight of you makes me sick” was very popular with such parents when I
was growing up.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 460 (Number of characters: 171):
It can still bring tears to my eyes to remember my emotionally abandoned young sister
secreted in a corner of the house begging our family dog: “Like me, Ginger, Like me!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 461 (Number of characters: 125):
Toxic Shame And Soul Murder
The rejecting responses of our parents to our emotional expression alienate us from our feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 462 (Number of characters: 126):
Emotional abuse/neglect scares us out of our own emotions while simultaneously making us
terrified of other people’s feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 463 (Number of characters: 89):
John Bradshaw describes the devastation of the child’s emotional nature as “soul murder”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 464 (Number of characters: 418):
He explains this as involving a process where the child’s emotional expression [his first language
of self-expression] is so assaulted with disgust that any emotional experience immediately
devolves into toxic shame. I believe that toxic shame is the affect of the inner critic, and that inner critic thought-
processes are the cognitions of shame – a terrible yin/yang process emanating from our original
abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 465 (Number of characters: 147):
Because of the deadly one-two punch of familial and societal attacks on our emotional selves, we
need to recover our innate emotional intelligence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 466 (Number of characters: 116):
This is also deeply important because, as Carl
Jung emphasized, our emotions tell us what is really important to us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 467 (Number of characters: 161):
When our emotional
intelligence is restricted, we often do not know what we really want, and can consequently
struggle mightily with even the smallest decisions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 468 (Number of characters: 115):
As emotional recovery progresses, the mindfulness described above begins to extend
toward our emotional experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 469 (Number of characters: 67):
This helps us to stop automatically dissociating from our
feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 470 (Number of characters: 96):
We then learn to identify our feelings and choose healthy ways to respond to them and
from them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 471 (Number of characters: 126):
Such emotional development illuminates our own natural preferences, and, in turn

aids us in making easier and better choices.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 472 (Number of characters: 264):
Towards the end of a long term therapy, a male client told me: “Yesterday, I was
contemplating what I have discovered in the years of our work together, and I’m amazed at how
much my values have shifted away from those of the macho family and culture I grew up in.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 473 (Number of characters: 161):
I
feel now like I prefer the arts to science, novels to non-fiction, gardening to watching golf, and
hanging out with my partner at home to partying at the bar.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 474 (Number of characters: 395):
Grieving As Emotional Intelligence
Grieving is the key process for reconnecting with our repressed emotional intelligence. Grieving
reconnects us with our full complement of feelings. Grieving is necessary to help us release and
work through our pain about the terrible losses of our childhoods. These losses are like deaths of
parts of our selves, and grieving can often initiate their rebirth.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 475 (Number of characters: 176):
Grieving And Verbal Ventilation
Grieving restores our crucial, developmentally arrested capacity to verbally ventilate. Verbal
ventilation is the penultimate grieving practice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 476 (Number of characters: 94):
It is speaking from your feelings in a way that
releases and resolves your emotional distress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 477 (Number of characters: 132):
I believe the following description of a six panel cartoon visually conveys the powerful
transformative power of verbal ventilation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 478 (Number of characters: 253):
In the first panel of the wordless cartoon, a woman
with a dark cloud over her head is talking to a friend who has a shining sun over hers. In panel
two, as the first woman gestures in a way that indicates complaining, the cloud covers her
friend’s sun.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 479 (Number of characters: 114):
In panel three, the cloud emits a bolt of lightning, as she angrily purges, and her
friend glowers along with her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 480 (Number of characters: 104):
In panel four, the cloud rains on them as they embrace,
commiserating in the rain of their shared tears.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 481 (Number of characters: 81):
In panel 5, relief spreads over their faces as the
cloud moves away from the sun.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 482 (Number of characters: 95):
In panel 6 the sun shines over both of them, as they smile and
slip into pleasant conversation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 483 (Number of characters: 115):
This cartoon reflects the fully realized power of verbal ventilation, which is the key bonding
process in intimacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 484 (Number of characters: 141):
It is also the key healing process of effective therapy, and here is an
example of what verbally ventilating looks like in a therapy session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 485 (Number of characters: 41):
A client arrives flashbacked and in pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 486 (Number of characters: 32):
He verbally ventilates about it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 487 (Number of characters: 91):
He is the regressed
hurt child, feeling bad, and part of him is sad and part of him is mad.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 488 (Number of characters: 137):
He is once again lost in the
painful feelings of his original abandonment, and this state is like a death that responds well to
grieving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 489 (Number of characters: 85):
As he lets his feelings come into his voice, he talks, cries and angers out his pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 490 (Number of characters: 82):
Through
this processing of his pain, he then gradually moves out of his flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 491 (Number of characters: 161):
He is restored to his
normal everyday sense that he is no longer trapped in his traumatic childhood. Relief about this
returns him to his normal ability to cope.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 492 (Number of characters: 83):
If his grieving is deep enough, he customarily feels
more hopeful and lighthearted.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 493 (Number of characters: 107):
Not infrequently, his sense of humor resurfaces, and laughter
punctuates his continuing verbal ventilation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 494 (Number of characters: 136):
This laughter is usually much different than the
sarcastic, self-bullying humor of his critic that he might have begun the session with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 495 (Number of characters: 496):
The inner critic is sometimes so hostile to grieving that shrinking the critic may need to be your
first recovery priority. Until the critic is sufficiently tamed, grieving can actually make
flashbacks worse, rather than perform the restorative processes it alone can initiate. I have worked with numerous clients who were so traumatized around grieving that we
needed to spend many months working on the cognitive level before grieving was released from
the spoiling effects of the toxic critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 496 (Number of characters: 92):
Chapter 11 provides a great deal of practical guidance for
restoring your ability to grieve.

chunk 497 (Number of characters: 225):
SPIRITUAL HEALING
Soothing Abandonment Losses Via A Higher Sense Of Belonging
Spiritual beliefs are of course a subject of personal and sometimes private concern, and I believe
and hope what I write here is not proselytizing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 498 (Number of characters: 99):
My aim, instead, is to point out psychological
concepts that have a non-sectarian spiritual aspect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 499 (Number of characters: 201):
I am aware, however, that some survivors
have suffered terrible spiritual abuse in childhood, and if the term “spiritual” is offensive or
triggering in any way, please feel free to bypass this section.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 500 (Number of characters: 50):
There are many other useful tools in
this toolbox.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 501 (Number of characters: 126):
A key aspect of the abandonment depression in Cptsd is the lack of a sense of belonging to
humanity, life, anyone or anything.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 502 (Number of characters: 119):
I have met many survivors whose first glimmer of
“belonging” came to them on a quest that began as a spiritual pursuit.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 503 (Number of characters: 91):
Finding nothing but
betrayal in the realm of humans, they turned to the spiritual for help.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 504 (Number of characters: 95):
Spiritual pursuits are sometimes fueled by an unconscious hope of finding a sense of
belonging.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 505 (Number of characters: 112):
The worst thing that can happen to a child is to be unwelcomed in his family of origin
- to never feel included.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 506 (Number of characters: 334):
Moreover, many survivors have little or no experience of any social
arena that feels safe and welcoming. Many survivors also do not find a sense of belonging in traditional or organized religions. Finding conventional religion too reminiscent of their dysfunctional families, some survivors
look to more solitary spiritual approaches.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 507 (Number of characters: 134):
They find a sense of belonging to something larger
and more comforting by reading spiritual books or engaging in meditative practices.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 508 (Number of characters: 67):
This also
allows them to bypass the danger of direct human contact.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 509 (Number of characters: 162):
Other survivors have spiritual experiences of belonging to something greater and
worthwhile by being in nature, by listening to music or by appreciating the arts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 510 (Number of characters: 190):
I once marveled
at a book, whose title now eludes me, that was a compendium of quotes from many renowned
people who had numinous experiences through the direct perception of nature’s beauty.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 511 (Number of characters: 175):
A numinous experience is a powerful moving feeling of well being accompanied by a sense
that there is a positive, benign force behind the universe, as well as within yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 512 (Number of characters: 176):
This in turn
sometimes brings enough grace with it, that you have a profound feeling that you are essentially
worthwhile, that you belong in this life, and that life is a gift.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 513 (Number of characters: 84):
One of my website respondents sent me her personal account of therapeutic gratitude.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 514 (Number of characters: 22):
Her name
is Mary Quinn

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 515 (Number of characters: 13):
[of Ireland].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 516 (Number of characters: 257):
In answer to my request to reprint her writing, she replied: “Yes, and
in honor of my little one and for all the times her voice went unheard, you may use my name.”
“I went to the beach a couple of days ago in the morning and sat watching the sun coming up.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 517 (Number of characters: 49):
I
had an incredible moment of the purest clarity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 518 (Number of characters: 98):
I was watching birds flying low over the water,
the moon was still visible and the sun was rising.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 519 (Number of characters: 84):
I realized I was looking at three planets and
there was not another person in sight.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 520 (Number of characters: 107):
“It was a moment of breathtaking beauty and the tears slid down my face at how deep it is
possible to feel.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 521 (Number of characters: 29):
I have been numb for so long.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 522 (Number of characters: 147):
I wrapped my arms around myself and felt the
presence of the little one so strongly it was almost painful but in a healing way if that makes
sense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 523 (Number of characters: 145):
I realized that all the life experiences I have had to date brought me to that exact moment
and gave me the depth to appreciate it at that level.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 524 (Number of characters: 142):
A sense of peace washed through me like a
gentle wave and for a few moments I felt a connection to a feeling of everything being part of
life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 525 (Number of characters: 32):
It was breathtakingly beautiful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 526 (Number of characters: 64):
I felt like I was experiencing this moment with all of my
senses

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 527 (Number of characters: 58):
and I never knew it was possible to be so much in my body.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 528 (Number of characters: 59):
“The gratitude feeling is deep and profound when it occurs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 529 (Number of characters: 210):
It feels like a moment of
connection to life itself on the deepest level and all life circumstances and what I deem as
problems pale to insignificance in those moments and there is only love in its purest form.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 530 (Number of characters: 109):
It
truly feels like a blessing albeit fleeting but gives enough sustenance and hope to continue the
journey.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 531 (Number of characters: 161):
Whatever the source, spiritual or numinous occurrences sometimes provide the survivor
with her first sense of belonging to something bigger and essentially good.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 532 (Number of characters: 175):
Such experiences can
lead a survivor to an author or speaker or fellow traveler with similar sensibilities, and
sometimes a door opens for finding comfort with a fellow human.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 533 (Number of characters: 125):
Eventually, this may even
grow into a sense that there are some humans out there who are good and safe enough to engage
with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 534 (Number of characters: 426):
Gratitude And Good Enough Parenting
When developing children receive “good enough parenting”, they feel that life is a gift even
though it typically comes with difficult and painful experiences. The term good enough parenting derives from the work of renowned adult and child
psychologist, D.W. Winnicott, who coined the term “good enough mothering” to describe his
observation that children do not need parents to be perfect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 535 (Number of characters: 187):
He noticed through his long career
that children grew up with their self-esteem and capacity for intimacy intact when their parents
were reasonably consistent with their love and support.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 536 (Number of characters: 112):
Nowadays, many therapists attach the phrase “good enough” to concepts like friend,
partner, therapist or person.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 537 (Number of characters: 187):
This is usually done to deconstruct perfectionistic expectations of
relationships - expectations that are so unrealistic that they are destructive to essentially
worthwhile relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 538 (Number of characters: 192):
When I apply the concept of “good enough” to people, I generally mean that a person is
essentially good hearted, tries to be fair, and meets his or her commitments a large portion of the
time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 539 (Number of characters: 162):
I also like to apply “good enough” to other concepts such as a good enough job, a good

enough try, a good enough outing, a good enough day or a good enough life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 540 (Number of characters: 181):
I apply this concept
liberally to contradict the black-and-white, all-or none thinking of the critic which reflexively
judges people and things as defective unless they are perfect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 541 (Number of characters: 83):
Good enough parents provide generous amounts of support, protection and comforting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 542 (Number of characters: 195):
They
also guide their children to deal constructively with recurring existential difficulties such as loss,
real villains, painful world events and normal disappointments with friends and family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 543 (Number of characters: 80):
Most importantly, they model how disappointments with intimates can be repaired.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 544 (Number of characters: 96):
A key
way they do this is to easily forgive their children for normal mistakes and shortcomings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 545 (Number of characters: 191):
Children who receive good enough parenting easily recognize and protect themselves from
bullying and exploitive people because they do not have to become accustomed to being treated
unfairly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 546 (Number of characters: 143):
Growing up in a safe and loving enough family naturally enhances the child’s capacity to
notice and enjoy the many gifts that life also brings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 547 (Number of characters: 104):
He learns that there is enough good in life to
significantly outweigh its necessary losses and travails.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 548 (Number of characters: 125):
In the traumatizing family however, there is little or nothing that is good enough and hence
little for which to be grateful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 549 (Number of characters: 131):
The child instead is forced to over-develop a critic that hyper-
focuses on what is dangerously imperfect in her as well as others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 550 (Number of characters: 141):
This sometimes helps her to
hide aspects of herself that might be punished. It may further assist her to avoid people who
might be punishing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 551 (Number of characters: 112):
Unfortunately, years of this habituates the child into only seeing herself, life and others in a
negative light.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 552 (Number of characters: 241):
Consequently, when she grows up and becomes free of her truly harmful family,
she cannot see that life offers her many new possibilities. Her ability to see the good in herself
and certain safe enough others remains developmentally arrested.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 553 (Number of characters: 61):
The cultivation of gratitude requires a balanced perspective.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 554 (Number of characters: 150):
You can learn to see and
appreciate the good in life without giving up your ability to discern what is truly negative and
unacceptable in the present.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 555 (Number of characters: 63):
SOMATIC HEALING
Trauma takes its toll on the body in many ways.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 556 (Number of characters: 143):
We need to comprehend the physical damage
that Cptsd wreaks on our bodies to motivate us to adopt practices that help us to heal on this
level.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 557 (Number of characters: 166):
Most of the physiological damage of extended trauma occurs because we are forced to
spend so much time in hyper-arousal – stuck in fight, flight, freeze or fawn mode.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 558 (Number of characters: 146):
When we are chronically stressed out [stuck in sympathetic nervous system activation],
detrimental somatic changes become ingrained in our bodies.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 559 (Number of characters: 752):
Here are some of the most
common examples of body-harming reactions to Cptsd stress:
Hypervigilance
Shallow and Incomplete Breathing
Constant Adrenalization

Armoring, i.e., Chronic muscle tightness
Wear and tear from rushing and armoring
Inability to be fully present, relaxed and grounded in our bodies
Sleep problems from being over-activated
Digestive disorders from a tightened digestive tract
Physiological damage from excessive self-medication with alcohol, food or drugs
Moreover, in cases of physical and sexual abuse, our capacities to be physically comforted by
touch are eliminated or compromised; and, in cases of verbal and emotional abuse, our capacities
to be comforted by eye- and voice-contact are undeveloped or seriously diminished.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 560 (Number of characters: 161):
Somatic Self-Help
The good news is that some somatic repair happens automatically when we reduce our
physiological stress by more efficient flashback management.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 561 (Number of characters: 152):
Particularly potent help also comes
from the grieving work of reclaiming the ability to cry self-compassionately and to express anger
self-protectively.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 562 (Number of characters: 143):
Both processes can release armoring, promote embodiment, improve sleep,
decrease hyperarousal and encourage deeper and more rhythmic breathing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 563 (Number of characters: 109):
Without further expressly somatic work, however, a full relaxed inhabitancy of your body
may not be achieved.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 564 (Number of characters: 94):
Fortunately, there are other modes of self-help for healing the
physiological wounds of Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 565 (Number of characters: 199):
The “Somatic Mindfulness” and “Introspective Somatic Work”
sections of chapter 12 describe techniques that can help you to decrease adrenalization, to relax
more deeply and to improve your digestion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 566 (Number of characters: 190):
Moreover, Step 7 of the flashback management steps
at the beginning of chapter 8 contains six somatic, self-help techniques for relaxing out of the
physiological hyperarousal of a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 567 (Number of characters: 58):
Another especially helpful somatic practice is stretching.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 568 (Number of characters: 366):
Regular systematic stretching of the
body’s major muscle groups can help you to reduce the armoring that occurs when your 4F
response is chronically triggered. This results from the fact that 4F activation tightens and
contracts your body in anticipation of the need to fight back, flee, get small to escape notice, or
rev up to launch into people-pleasing activity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 569 (Number of characters: 227):
Learning to stretch was a major ordeal for me because of my extreme body armoring. As
noted above, it was a task of self-nurturing that I resented intensely, and it took me a long time to
adopt stretching as a regular practice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 570 (Number of characters: 137):
The fact that I had to weather many toxic shame attacks because I was always the least
flexible person in the group did not help matters.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 571 (Number of characters: 159):
Moreover, when various people commented
about how good it felt to stretch, I felt both puzzled and further shamed, because it was anything
but pleasant for me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 572 (Number of characters: 170):
Thankfully however, reading the literature about it convinced me about its great
importance, and persistent practice eventually gave me results that I could not discount.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 573 (Number of characters: 62):
I was
rewarded by the resolution of decades old back problems.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 574 (Number of characters: 163):
And although I still rarely enjoy the
practice, I am absolutely convinced that it explains why I am still able to run, swim and play

basketball in my mid sixties.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 575 (Number of characters: 71):
Stretching has become for me a true labor of love and self-
nurturance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 576 (Number of characters: 126):
Yoga, massage, meditation and relaxation training are formalized disciplines to aid in letting go
of unnecessary body tension.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 577 (Number of characters: 88):
Reasonably priced classes in these modalities are usually available
in most communities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 578 (Number of characters: 133):
Finally, freeze types and freeze subtypes also typically benefit from various types of movement
therapy and aerobic exercise regimes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 579 (Number of characters: 175):
Moreover, assertiveness training and anger release work
are especially helpful for survivors who have difficulty accessing their assertiveness or instincts
of self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 580 (Number of characters: 281):
Cptsd And Somatic Therapy
There are also various somatic therapies that can help our bodies heal. As with my earlier
comments about CBT, I encourage you to be wary of somatic approaches that claim to heal
Cptsd without working on the cognitive and emotional levels described above.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 581 (Number of characters: 130):
Some approaches,
in fact, blanketly dismiss cognitive work in a way that sidesteps the crucial work of shrinking the
inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 582 (Number of characters: 209):
Some approaches also believe that their techniques eliminate the fundamental
necessity of grieving the losses of childhood, and understanding how abusive and negligent
parenting is at the root of our problems.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 583 (Number of characters: 212):
Nonetheless, some somatic therapists can ease the physiological traumas that are locked in
our bodies, as long as the practitioner is not actively dismissing or impeding the client’s
cognitive and emotional work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 584 (Number of characters: 56):
In this vein, it is my opinion that techniques like EMDR

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 585 (Number of characters: 114):
[Eye Movement Desensitization
Reprocessing] and Somatic Experiencing are very powerful tools for stress-reduction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 586 (Number of characters: 53):
They are
especially helpful in resolving simple ptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 587 (Number of characters: 167):
However, they are not complete Cptsd therapies,
unless the practitioner is eclectic enough to be incorporating inner critic and grieving-the-losses-
of-childhood work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 588 (Number of characters: 91):
Other helpful somatic techniques include Rosen Work, Rolfing, Rebirthing and Reichian
work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 589 (Number of characters: 126):
These techniques can also be very helpful in aiding the recovery of the ability to
therapeutically emote both tears and anger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 590 (Number of characters: 90):
For survivors of physical and/or sexual abuse, I believe Rosen Work is especially helpful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 591 (Number of characters: 105):
I
found that Rosen Work’s emphasis on soft touch helped heal my Cptsd startle response to
physical touch.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 592 (Number of characters: 128):
A startle response is the sudden full body-flinching that survivors experience at
loud noises or unanticipated physical contact.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 593 (Number of characters: 55):
This is usually a somatic flashback to previous
abuses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 594 (Number of characters: 99):
In my case, the startle response was installed in me by my parents through frequent face-
slapping.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 595 (Number of characters: 157):
As a lap-swimmer in public pools, it has taken me ages to significantly reduce being
triggered by the hand and arm movements of people who swim alongside me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 596 (Number of characters: 104):
I also had to shop around to find a Rosen worker who welcomed my use of the verbal

ventilation process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 597 (Number of characters: 118):
Some practitioners prefer to work in silence, and this limits or eliminates the
therapeutic benefit to most survivors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 598 (Number of characters: 211):
It is also important to emphasize here that somatic therapies can be especially helpful in
healing the anxiety reaction to touch and physical closeness that many survivors of physical or
sexual abuse experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 599 (Number of characters: 158):
Exceptions to this are the survivors that I have met who have
experienced remediation of this symptom through the help of an especially kind and safe partner.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 600 (Number of characters: 326):
The Role Of Medication
As a psychotherapist, I am not authorized to give pharmaceutical advice, but I have frequently
noticed that survivors who need pharmaceutical help seem to benefit most from SSRI anti-
depressants. Taken at the right dosage SSRI’s do not usually blunt your affect in a way that
makes grieving impossible.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 601 (Number of characters: 172):
Moreover, if your critic does not budge with extended critic-
shrinking work, SSRI’s can usually reduce its volume and vitriol enough so that you can
effectively shrink it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 602 (Number of characters: 63):
Once it is diminished enough, you can dispense with medication.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 603 (Number of characters: 138):
One
caveat here is that unless you do extensive critic shrinking work, the critic will be as strong as
ever when the medications wear off.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 604 (Number of characters: 195):
Self-Medication
For those who have been repeatedly unsuccessful at stopping or reducing the use of non-
therapeutic medications and substances, Gabor Mate’s work on harm reduction may be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 605 (Number of characters: 309):
Drug and alcohol recovery is beyond the scope of this book, but if you are stuck in habits of self-
medication that are not allowing you to progress in your Cptsd recovery, I encourage you to get
help from a substance abuse recovery program or from Twelve Step programs like Alcoholics or
Narcotics Anonymous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 606 (Number of characters: 106):
Working With Food Issues
Let us explore one last arena of physical healing, and that is dietary self-help.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 607 (Number of characters: 119):
I agree with John
Bradshaw who says that almost everyone who grows up in a dysfunctional family has an eating
disorder.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 608 (Number of characters: 88):
This is a key factor in the digestive track problems that are a common symptom of
Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 609 (Number of characters: 51):
Changing your eating habits is extremely difficult.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 610 (Number of characters: 132):
A client left this quote on my waiting
room bulletin board: “Alcohol and other drug recovery is like dealing with a tiger in a cage.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 611 (Number of characters: 122):
Recovery from eating disorders is like taking that tiger out of the cage three times a day and then
taking it for a walk.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 612 (Number of characters: 124):
Deconstructing food addictions, then, is daunting work that needs to be approached
gradually and with a sense of compassion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 613 (Number of characters: 92):
This is because children who are traumatically
abandoned naturally turn to food for comfort.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 614 (Number of characters: 139):
Food offers us our first outside source of self-
soothing, and when a child is starving for love, he frequently makes food his love object.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 615 (Number of characters: 65):
Over
the years he commonly “elevates” it to the status of a drug.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 616 (Number of characters: 151):
Moreover, increasing scientific
evidence is showing that processed food products combining high levels of sugar, salt and fat are
especially addictive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 617 (Number of characters: 35):
Food addictions begin pre-verbally.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 618 (Number of characters: 117):
They are functional and useful at the time and help us
to survive the unbearable feelings of the abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 619 (Number of characters: 268):
Unfortunately, we are typically
forced to rely on food-soothing for so long that this over-dependence is extremely difficult to
overcome, and I do not recommend that anyone in early recovery make this their primary focus
unless they have a life-threatening food issue.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 620 (Number of characters: 62):
Instead, I prefer to recommend Mate’s harm
reduction approach.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 621 (Number of characters: 140):
Additionally, Geneen Roth’s book, Breaking Free from Compulsive Eating,
also offers a moderate and sensible approach to dietary improvement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 622 (Number of characters: 138):
While many survivors can be unconscious of their damaging eating habits, I have met
various survivors who take it to the opposite extreme.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 623 (Number of characters: 183):
I was once in the ranks of those who
obsessively over-focus on dietary self-help hoping and expecting that all their suffering will be
resolved if they can just find the perfect diet.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 624 (Number of characters: 73):
Many also chase after every new highly touted
supplement in this pursuit.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 625 (Number of characters: 49):
Some of us also approach exercise in this manner.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 626 (Number of characters: 163):
These are understandable but simplistic versions of the salvation fantasy, and are typically
pursued at the exclusion of working on more core issues of recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 627 (Number of characters: 97):
Nonetheless, almost
everyone has some ideas about how they can eat [and exercise] more healthily.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 628 (Number of characters: 89):
My
recommendation is to try dietary adjustments when you can on a moderate, doable level.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 629 (Number of characters: 182):
IMPROVING RELATIONSHIPS
Forewarning:
There are instances of parental betrayal so extreme, that it is not fair or reasonable to expect the
survivor to try to trust human beings again.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 630 (Number of characters: 143):
If the recommendation in this chapter to open to the
help of others feels too upsetting or overwhelming, please feel free to skip this chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 631 (Number of characters: 209):
There is
a great deal of other material in this book that can help alleviate the many symptoms of Cptsd,
and since recovery is relative and never complete, you do not need to implement everything in
this book.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 632 (Number of characters: 76):
As they say in the Twelve Step Movement: “Take the best and leave the rest.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 633 (Number of characters: 189):
Moreover, as I have experienced personally, and as numerous of my clients and website
respondents have demonstrated to me, real relational healing can and does come from non-
human sources.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 634 (Number of characters: 159):
This is especially true of mammalian pets whose attachment needs and wiring
are similar enough to ours that mutually healing connections can evolve between us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 635 (Number of characters: 159):
Dogs and
cats can be a tremendous source of what Carl Rogers describes as the “unconditional positive
regard” that young children must have in order to thrive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 636 (Number of characters: 72):
Other therapeutic relational sources include nature, music and the arts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 637 (Number of characters: 123):
Moreover, for some
survivors, authors of helpful books can be kept at safe distances while they contribute to your
healing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 638 (Number of characters: 169):
Finally, even with the most heinous betrayals, miracles sometime happen in terms of
discovering a healing human connection, particularly in the later stages of recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 639 (Number of characters: 84):
Cptsd As An Attachment Disorder
Many therapists see Cptsd as an attachment disorder.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 640 (Number of characters: 92):
This means that as a child the survivor
grew up without a safe adult to healthily bond with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 641 (Number of characters: 75):
As bears repeating, Cptsd almost always has

emotional neglect at its core.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 642 (Number of characters: 145):
A key outcome of this is that the child has no one in his formative
years who models the relational skills that are necessary to create intimacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 643 (Number of characters: 188):
When the developmental need to practice healthy relating with a caretaker is unmet,
survivors typically struggle to find and maintain healthy supportive relationships in their adult
lives.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 644 (Number of characters: 163):
The Origin Of Social Anxiety
A child who grows up with no reliable human source of love, support and protection typically
falls into a great deal of social unease.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 645 (Number of characters: 128):
He “naturally” becomes reluctant to seek support from
anyone, and he is forced to adopt self-sufficiency as a survival strategy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 646 (Number of characters: 59):
Needing anything from others can feel especially dangerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 647 (Number of characters: 118):
The survivor’s innate capacity
to experience comfort and support in relationship becomes very limited or non-existent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 648 (Number of characters: 106):
This is
despite the fact that many high functioning survivors learn to socially function quite adequately.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 649 (Number of characters: 166):
This is particularly the case in structured situations where expectations are clear and
common goals take the focus off conversing and put it on task accomplishments.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 650 (Number of characters: 119):
Unstructured
social situations however, like attending parties or just hanging out can be considerably more
triggering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 651 (Number of characters: 92):
Spontaneous self-expression feels like the same setup for disaster that it was in
childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 652 (Number of characters: 109):
Either way, structured or spontaneous, relating often involves hiding a great deal of anxiety
and discomfort.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 653 (Number of characters: 101):
One very successful businessman client of mine told me: “I’m so cool, calm and
collected in meetings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 654 (Number of characters: 58):
A veritable wordsmith with the composure of Michael Caine.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 655 (Number of characters: 123):
I’m a king
on the outside, but on the inside I’m a drama queen anguishing in doubt and shame about
everything I say or do.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 656 (Number of characters: 111):
In worst case scenarios, social anxiety can devolve into social phobia, especially during
prolonged flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 657 (Number of characters: 75):
Extensive childhood abuse installs a powerful people-are-dangerous
program.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 658 (Number of characters: 90):
When I was at my least recovered, I couldn’t take out the garbage when I was in flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 659 (Number of characters: 131):
I feared that my neighbor – my sweet, always affirming neighbor – would look out the window
and see how wretched and pitiful I was.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 660 (Number of characters: 88):
Even worse, I dreaded the prospect that she might come
out and want to interact with me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 661 (Number of characters: 174):
Nonetheless, I socialized for decades when necessary, and seemed to be doing it with a
considerable amount of success, no matter how dreadful the reviews were from my critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 662 (Number of characters: 91):
I even
eventually came to see, when not in flashback, that a lot of people really liked me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 663 (Number of characters: 239):
Unfortunately, however, I rarely derived any satisfaction or comfort from this perception,
because underneath my smooth persona, I was writhing in discomfort, and typically measuring
the time until I could least obtrusively make my escape.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 664 (Number of characters: 143):
A Journey Of Relational Healing
The incident I am about to describe marked a huge step in my long, gradual journey of opening
to real intimacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 665 (Number of characters: 161):
I was sitting on my porch with my dog George, the only being I could truly
relax with, when he broke his lead and sprinted across the street in pursuit of a cat.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 666 (Number of characters: 79):
Before he
could get to the cat, he was run over by a car – both axels-run over.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 667 (Number of characters: 147):
It was the worst thing that

ever happened in my adult life, and when the shock [dissociation] wore off, I was drowning in
the abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 668 (Number of characters: 65):
Beyond devastated, I felt panicky and catatonic at the same time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 669 (Number of characters: 146):
As I had to in childhood
when feeling overwhelmed, I hid in my room for thirty-six hours - dreading contact with my fair
weather friend-roommates.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 670 (Number of characters: 69):
I was 28 and still thoroughly phobic about showing any vulnerability.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 671 (Number of characters: 164):
All my relationships had been developed under the guise of my people-pleasing, funny guy
persona, and in my current state there was not a joke anywhere to be found.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 672 (Number of characters: 84):
There was no way I
would let myself be seen in what felt like a repulsive condition.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 673 (Number of characters: 138):
I could not sleep, and as sleep deprivation deteriorated into a fear that I was truly going
crazy, out of nowhere came this amazing grace.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 674 (Number of characters: 45):
Grace disguised in a form I usually abhorred.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 675 (Number of characters: 133):
It
was the grace of a deep surrender into weeping - a long sobbing release more soothing than
anything I had ever experienced before.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 676 (Number of characters: 85):
It was the release I describe in chapter 11 and extensively throughout my first book.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 677 (Number of characters: 52):
When
the tears were cried out I knew I would be okay

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 678 (Number of characters: 39):
and I knew I was not going to go crazy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 679 (Number of characters: 100):
I could
face my roommates with the realest, perhaps the first sense of self-esteem I had ever known.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 680 (Number of characters: 79):
And
from that point on, I knew I wanted more of these incredibly healing tears.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 681 (Number of characters: 192):
Healing The Shame That Binds Us In Loneliness
I soon discovered however, that my tears were as stuck as they had ever been, or at least since I
was six – the last time I could remember crying.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 682 (Number of characters: 179):
Further reading and researching then lead me to
seek help, and so ensued my baptism into therapy, blessed by the great fortune of finding a good
enough therapist on the first try.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 683 (Number of characters: 199):
This was a milestone achievement for me, and it evolved into a long meandering journey of
finding more relational help with an array of healers, therapists, therapeutic groups and deeper
friendships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 684 (Number of characters: 125):
These experiences ranged from extremely helpful to counter-therapeutic, but as time
went on they became increasingly helpful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 685 (Number of characters: 115):
A central aspect of the truly helpful relational work was what John Bradshaw called
“healing the shame that binds.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 686 (Number of characters: 68):
I believe toxic shame cannot be healed without some relational
help.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 687 (Number of characters: 137):
Several therapists and groups aided me greatly to unbind from the shame that made me
hide whenever I could not invoke my perfect persona.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 688 (Number of characters: 98):
Concurrently, I learned that real intimacy
correlated with the amount I shared my vulnerabilities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 689 (Number of characters: 104):
As I increasingly practiced emotional
authenticity, the glacier of my lifelong loneliness began to melt.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 690 (Number of characters: 113):
It is important to note here that groups can be even more powerful for the healing of shame
than individual work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 691 (Number of characters: 96):
This is because there is typically more mutual vulnerability in a group than
in individual work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 692 (Number of characters: 532):
Moreover, feeling compassion for someone who has suffered similarly to us
sometimes naturally expands into feeling the same for ourselves. Therapeutic relational experiences enhanced my self-compassion considerably further than
what I was able to accomplish on my own. Moreover, I believe that insufficient self-compassion
is the worst developmental arrest of all, and restored self-compassion is the keystone of all
effective recovery. In retrospect I can clearly see that as my self-compassion increased, my toxic shame
decreased.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 693 (Number of characters: 166):
Modern advances in neuroscience [see: A General Theory of Love] suggest that we
are intrinsically limited in our ability to emotionally regulate and soothe ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 694 (Number of characters: 150):
More and

more research suggests that our ability to metabolize painful emotional states is enhanced by
communicating with a safe enough other person.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 695 (Number of characters: 259):
Finding Good Enough Relational Help
In chapter 13, I provide guidance about how to shop for a good enough therapist. I also explore
more deeply the principles of therapeutic relational healing to help you know what is reasonable
to expect from your therapist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 696 (Number of characters: 205):
I have also met a number of survivors who have been lucky enough to get this kind of relational
healing from a partner or a friend, typically one who had good enough parents or who “has a lot
of recovery”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 697 (Number of characters: 191):
Finally, attachment theorists have developed the concept of earned secure attachment to
describe the recovered enough state where the attachment disorder of Cptsd becomes sufficiently
healed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 698 (Number of characters: 109):
This is typically evidenced by the survivor forming at least one supportive and reliable
enough relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 699 (Number of characters: 137):
Many of the successful therapies I have guided come to an end when the client gains an
earned secure relationship outside of our therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 700 (Number of characters: 88):

Many respondents to my website have reported glowingly about the help they get from others
through online recovery groups and forums.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 704 (Number of characters: 106):
These groups can be particularly helpful for those
who still find it difficult to be vulnerable in person.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 705 (Number of characters: 154):
Sometimes the distance and relative
anonymity of these forums can decrease the fear of self-disclosure, and this in turn can enhance
therapeutic relating.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 706 (Number of characters: 100):
An increasing number of therapists also seem to be offering telephone
sessions for this same reason.

Parentdectomy And Relational Healing
I have worked with many clients who began therapy with me while they were still over-
controlled by their traumatizing parents – both externally, as well as internally.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 709 (Number of characters: 73):
Sometimes the
control was enforced by as little as one phone call a week.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 710 (Number of characters: 161):
Not infrequently, these clients were also being overpowered and /or abandoned in
relationships as abusive and neglectful as the ones they had with their parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 711 (Number of characters: 121):
This is repetition
compulsion at its most destructive, and it strands survivors in experiencing the worst of both
worlds.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 712 (Number of characters: 174):
Through in depth exploration of their childhood trauma, many of my still-trapped clients

achieved psychological freedom from their parents for the first time in their lives.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 713 (Number of characters: 125):
Once again,
this was a freedom that they had not actually achieved even though they had been living on their
own for decades.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 714 (Number of characters: 129):
These clients gradually learned to live more successfully on their own without their parents
over-controlling spoiling influence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 715 (Number of characters: 179):
Their ability to build self-nurturing relationships with
themselves almost always correlated with a major reduction or complete severing of their
relationships with their parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 716 (Number of characters: 133):
My client, Joe, who was variously misdiagnosed as Schizoid, Asperger’s, and Paranoid,
was living alone when he began therapy with me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 717 (Number of characters: 123):
He was extremely shut down and self-
contained but recognized himself as a freeze type from reading articles on my website.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 718 (Number of characters: 384):
Getting him to talk at first was like pulling teeth, but over time I discovered that he was
engaged in daily phone contact with his narcissistic, emasculating mother. Through our work and
tremendous courage on his part, he gradually reduced the phone contact with his mother: at first
to once a week, then once a month, then only major holidays, and after a few years to almost
never.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 719 (Number of characters: 134):
When a parent is unrelentingly toxic, hearing even a few words from them can trigger the
survivor into an intense emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 720 (Number of characters: 139):
I have worked with numerous clients who made
very little progress in their recovery while they maintained contact with the toxic parent[s].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 721 (Number of characters: 74):
For
this reason, such clients usually require a parentdectomy to progress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 722 (Number of characters: 97):
There is a classic book by
Bob Hoffman on this topic entitled Getting Divorced from Mother & Dad.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 723 (Number of characters: 119):
As external freedom from “smother-mothering” continued, Joe gradually achieved more
and more internal freedom from her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 724 (Number of characters: 198):
During this time he began to experience the first meaningful
relating of his life in an ACA group that for many years provided him with a great deal of
positive companionship and relational healing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 725 (Number of characters: 135):
Joe finally concluded therapy with me when a
healthy primary relationship that he formed with a group member reached the two year mark.

chunk 726 (Number of characters: 229):
Learning To Handle Conflict In Relationship
One caveat for recovering the ability to authentically be yourself is that it is unreasonable and
unfair to expect anyone to accept you if you are being abusively angry or contemptuous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 727 (Number of characters: 97):
Some
trauma survivors flashback into this type of behavior by acting out from their Outer Critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 728 (Number of characters: 108):
If this
is an issue for you, chapter 10 provides guidance for deconstructing this intimacy-destroying
habit.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 729 (Number of characters: 85):
In this vein, it is important to note that intimacy does not mean unconditional love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 730 (Number of characters: 136):
As John
Gottman’s scholarly research shows, a certain amount of disagreement, disaffection and
disappointment is normal in relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 731 (Number of characters: 121):
The hallmark of successful couples is their ability to
handle feelings of anger and hurt in a constructive and civil way.

Gottman’s studies have
identified this as a key characteristic of couples who still really like each other after ten years.

Reparenting

Reparenting is a key aspect of relational healing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 737 (Number of characters: 118):
It is primarily a process of addressing the many
developmentally arrested needs of the traumatized child that we were.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 738 (Number of characters: 96):
In this book we repeatedly
address the two most fundamental of these needs: love and protection.

chunk 739 (Number of characters: 35):
“Suggested Intentions for Recovery”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 740 (Number of characters: 144):
[Toolbox 1 in chapter 16] renders yet another picture
of the diverse developmental arrests that may as yet be unaddressed in the Cptsd survivor.

--------------------------------------------------

The
toolbox presents these needs as tangible goals that we can use to direct our recovery efforts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 742 (Number of characters: 134):
Self-Mothering And Self-Fathering
An important, yin/yang dynamic of reparenting involves balancing self-mothering and self-
fathering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 743 (Number of characters: 197):
When a child’s mothering needs are adequately met, self-compassion is installed at the
core of her being. When the same is true of her fathering needs, self-protection also becomes
deeply imbedded.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 744 (Number of characters: 238):
Self-compassion is the domicile of recovery, and self-protection is its foundation. When
self-compassion is sufficiently established as a “home base” to return to in difficult times, an
urge to be self-protective naturally arises from it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 745 (Number of characters: 93):
Living in the world without access to these
primal instincts of survival is truly terrifying.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 746 (Number of characters: 104):
We advance our recovery process immeasurably when we commit to re-mothering and re-
fathering ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 747 (Number of characters: 106):
I encourage you now to commit to becoming an unshakeable source of
compassion and protection for yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 748 (Number of characters: 291):
Self-Mothering Grows Self-Compassion
The most essential task of self-mothering is building a deeply felt sense that we are lovable and
deserve to be loved. Self-mothering is the practice of loving and accepting the inner child in all
phases of his mental, emotional, and physical experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 749 (Number of characters: 131):
[If “inner child” is a problematic
concept for any reason, you can imagine nurturing the developmentally arrested part of yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 750 (Number of characters: 93):
]
Self-mothering is based on the precept that unconditional love is every child’s birthright.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 751 (Number of characters: 62):
Recovering from the loss of unconditional love is problematic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 752 (Number of characters: 66):
Not getting enough of it as
children was the greatest loss we had.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 753 (Number of characters: 169):
Sadly, this loss can never be completely remediated,
because unconditional love is only appropriate and developmentally helpful during the first two
years or so of life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 754 (Number of characters: 94):
After this time, the toddler has to begin to learn that human love comes with some
conditions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 755 (Number of characters: 160):
Although love still needs to be copious at this time, the child must be gently shown
that behaviors like hitting, biting and breaking things are not acceptable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 756 (Number of characters: 153):
The period of
conditional love has begun and is successfully guided via a very gradual increase in learning
about necessary and healthy limits and rules.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 757 (Number of characters: 143):
The toddler who receives good enough parenting learns relatively easily to survive the very
gradually diminishing supply of unconditional love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 758 (Number of characters: 90):
During this time she learns little by little that
other people also have rights and needs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 759 (Number of characters: 140):
Her absolute entitlement to gratification is coming to an
end, and the needs of her parents will not always be forfeited to accommodate her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 760 (Number of characters: 129):
Once again, psychological health is based on having about two years of this no questions
asked entitlement to unconditional love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 761 (Number of characters: 83):
It is the normal healthy narcissism that Freud described
as “His Majesty the Baby”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 762 (Number of characters: 123):
Serious problems accrue however when the toddler does not begin to learn that there are
limits to his original entitlement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 763 (Number of characters: 85):
If there are no limits for too long, then the journey toward adult
narcissism begins.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 764 (Number of characters: 94):
On the other hand, if there are too many limits too soon, the matrix of trauma
begins to form.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 765 (Number of characters: 55):
Enlightened parents introduce limits slowly but surely.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 766 (Number of characters: 154):
They do it at such a rate that by the
time the child reaches adolescence he can balance satisfying his needs with helping his intimates
to satisfy theirs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 767 (Number of characters: 117):
He learns to be sharing and reciprocal, a developmental task that is essential to
keeping intimacy alive in his life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 768 (Number of characters: 240):
Cptsd is a syndrome of the dearth of unconditional love, or what the great therapist, Carl
Rogers, called “unconditional positive regard”. Cptsd can also occur when unconditional love is
shut off in an all-or-nothing way in early childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 769 (Number of characters: 39):
Some parents can shower love on babies.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 770 (Number of characters: 127):
But as soon as the child begins toddling around
and expressing a will of her own, they become severely punishing and rejecting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 771 (Number of characters: 165):
The Limits Of Unconditional Love
The terrible absence of love - or its abrupt premature termination - is extremely painful and its
loss is very difficult to address.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 772 (Number of characters: 175):
We cannot help desperately wanting the unconditional love we
were so unfairly deprived of, but we cannot, as adults, expect others to supply our unmet early
entitlement needs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 773 (Number of characters: 97):
The one exception to this is therapy, but that of course is usually only one or two hours a
week.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 774 (Number of characters: 343):
Miraculously, I have seen the unconditional positive regard of the therapist be enough on
numerous occasions to significantly repair the damage of not being parentally loved. And when
it is enough, the therapist’s consistent caring facilitates the awakening of the developmentally
arrested need to hold yourself with enough unconditional love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 775 (Number of characters: 152):
We survivors often struggle with managing our understandable but unrealistic yearnings to
receive permanent unconditional love from a friend or partner.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 776 (Number of characters: 72):
Like the toddler, we eventually
have to accept the limits of adult love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 777 (Number of characters: 112):
This is especially true in romance where the intoxication
of unconditional love rarely lasts for more than year.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 778 (Number of characters: 134):
Around this time, partners inevitably begin
to feel some frustration with each other because of differences in their individual needs.

--------------------------------------------------

Nonetheless, romantic love can be a significant source of therapeutic unconditional-like
love, especially when it survives the inevitability of some disappointment.

Let us return to the concept of self-mothering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 781 (Number of characters: 102):
As mother to ourselves, we commit to increasing
our self-compassion and unconditional positive regard.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 782 (Number of characters: 84):
Self-mothering is a resolute refusal to
indulge in self-hatred and self-abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 783 (Number of characters: 77):
It proceeds from the realization that self-

punishment is counterproductive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 784 (Number of characters: 153):
It is enhanced by the understanding that patience and self-
encouragement are more effective than self-judgment and self-rejection in achieving recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 785 (Number of characters: 165):
You can enhance your self-mothering skills by imaginatively creating a safe place in your
heart where your inner child and your present time self are always welcome.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 786 (Number of characters: 181):

Self-Fathering And Time Machine Rescue Operation
Many abandoned children enter adulthood feeling that the world is a dangerous place where they
are ill-equipped to defend themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 808 (Number of characters: 285):
While self-mothering focuses primarily on healing the
wounds of neglect, self-fathering heals the wounds of being helpless to protect yourself from
parental abuse, and by extension from other abusive authority figures. Self-fathering aims at building assertiveness and self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 809 (Number of characters: 171):
It includes learning to
effectively confront external and/or internal abuse, as well as standing up for the adult child’s
rights, as described in Tool Box 2 of chapter 16.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 810 (Number of characters: 80):
Many survivors benefit greatly from classes and
books on assertiveness training.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 811 (Number of characters: 81):
One of my favorite self-fathering exercises is the time machine rescue operation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 812 (Number of characters: 51):
I have

used it to help myself and to help clients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 813 (Number of characters: 141):
With clients I use it to model a process for fighting off
the overwhelming sense of helplessness that often accompanies emotional flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 814 (Number of characters: 105):
This is a version of the time machine rescue operation that I use with myself as well as with
my clients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 815 (Number of characters: 136):
I tell my inner child that, if time travel is ever possible, I will travel back into the past
and put a stop to my parents’ abusiveness.

chunk 816 (Number of characters: 56):
In the course of this I say things like: “I’ll call 911.

Reparenting By Committee
Reparenting at its best is a yin/yang dynamic that balances the mutually enhancing processes of
reparenting by others and self-reparenting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 832 (Number of characters: 181):
Reparenting sometimes needs to be initiated and
modeled by someone else, such as a therapist, a sponsor, a kind friend or supportive group to
show us how to self-reparent ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 833 (Number of characters: 150):
Alternatively, many survivors instinctively initiate reparenting by others, via entering what
one of my clients describes as “the community of books”.

They receive reparenting from authors
who encourage them to value and support themselves.

chunk 835 (Number of characters: 26):
Alice was such a survivor.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 836 (Number of characters: 174):

she quickly learned that being vulnerable around others was dangerous, foolish and totally out of
the question.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 837 (Number of characters: 159):
Yet the urge to get the support and the help she was so unfairly deprived of worked
its way back into her awareness via a strong attraction to self-help books.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 838 (Number of characters: 214):
By reading a great deal
of psychology, she eventually found enough help that she began to think that there might be a
kind, safe and helpful person out there in the flesh and entered into some very helpful therapy.

[Chapter 15, Bibliotherapy, contains my favorite recommendations for therapeutic self-help

chunk 840 (Number of characters: 396):
I too went through a long gradual process of reading and attending lectures before I was
able to take the frightening and embarrassing plunge into therapy, where, as stated earlier, I was
fortunate enough to find a good enough therapist to take my relational healing to the next level. Therapy allowed me to internalize and mimic my therapists’ consistent and reliable stance
of being on my side.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 841 (Number of characters: 83):
This in turn led me to gravitate toward safer and more truly intimate

friendships.

Fortunately I am now blessed many years later to
experience a multileveled form of reparenting by others which I call reparenting by committee.

chunk 846 (Number of characters: 190):
I
conceptualize reparenting by committee as a circle of friends that has varying layers and levels of
intimacy. The inner circle of my reparenting committee includes my five closest friends.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 847 (Number of characters: 99):
I think of this inner circle as friends with whom nothing is too vulnerable or taboo to talk
about.

--------------------------------------------------

My wife, a therapist friend, my exercise buddy and two members of a long term men’s
group that I was in are in this circle.

This circle also has an outer layer of people who would be
inner if circumstances allowed me to see them more.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 850 (Number of characters: 290):
Outside this orb are levels of succeeding less intimate, yet still meaningful circles of
relationship. The next circle out is intimates who I rarely see anymore but who have shared
enough intimacy with me in the past that I now draw comfort from imagining them caring for me
in the present.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 851 (Number of characters: 208):
My deceased grandmother is in this circle as are three of my former therapists, a
couple of army buddies, old high school and college friends, and my four best friends from the
ten years I lived in Australia.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 852 (Number of characters: 204):
The next circle out from this consists of my nurse practitioner, the body worker I
occasionally see, some therapist colleagues and the wise old school librarian who helps me pick
books for my son to read.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 853 (Number of characters: 263):
The next circle out from this are friends I play sports with, parents of my son’s friends and
people in my neighborhood with whom my contact is not especially vulnerable, but with whom
there is an easy chemistry that adds to my general overall sense of belonging.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 854 (Number of characters: 127):

and comforting interactions with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 856 (Number of characters: 96):
And like me, their committees, started with the first
person they had good enough intimacy with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 857 (Number of characters: 117):
Counting yourself, this then is a committee of two,
which with grace can then build slowly, one friendship at a time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 858 (Number of characters: 115):
The Tao Of Self-Relating And Relating To Others
Recovering is therefore enhanced on every level by safe human help.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 859 (Number of characters: 201):
Once again however,
survivors with especially harsh betrayal histories may need to do a great deal of work on other
levels before they are ready to risk the vulnerability of opening to relational help.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 860 (Number of characters: 136):
Nonetheless, deep level recovering, as well as healthy “human-being” is typically a
vacillating blend of self-help and help from others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 861 (Number of characters: 197):
Relational work helps heal the initial wound
of family abandonment, and self work decreases the self-abandonment that occurs because the
child was forced to imitate his parents’ abandonment of him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 862 (Number of characters: 219):
The more time you practice the
various techniques of self-care described throughout this book, the less time you spend in self-
abandonment. With enough persistence, self-care becomes an invaluable, irreplaceable habit.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 863 (Number of characters: 82):
In advanced recovery, self-help and relational-help blend in an all important Tao.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 864 (Number of characters: 69):
A Tao is a
yin/yang combination of opposite and complementary forces.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 865 (Number of characters: 105):
The Tao of relational recovery
involves balancing healthy independence with healthy dependence on others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 866 (Number of characters: 331):
For the survivor, this therapeutic synthesis can come into being when an improved
supportive relationship with yourself allows you to choose and open to a helpful relationship. Sometimes simultaneously, the attainment of a safe, supportive relationship with another person
promotes the growth of your ability to be self-supportive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 867 (Number of characters: 89):
This then rewards you with a decrease
in your automatic tendency toward self-abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 868 (Number of characters: 149):
Complementarily, this then fosters the
gradual development of community – the vital life resource that you were so unfairly deprived of
in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 869 (Number of characters: 145):
The more self-supportive we become the more we attract supportive others. The more we
are supported by others, the more we can support ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 870 (Number of characters: 147):
Sometimes we get initiated into this
dynamic Tao by our own efforts - sometimes by the grace of finding a supportive friend or
professional helper.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 871 (Number of characters: 210):
For many of us survivors a considerable amount of self-help work has to take place before
we are able to open to relational support – before we become discerning enough to choose truly
safe and helpful support.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 872 (Number of characters: 128):
THE PROGRESSION OF RECOVERING
Signs Of Recovering
Effective recovery work leads to an ongoing reduction of emotional flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 873 (Number of characters: 89):
Over time, with
enough practice, you become more proficient at managing triggered states.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 874 (Number of characters: 92):
This in turn results in
flashbacks occurring less often, less intensely and less enduringly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 875 (Number of characters: 250):
Another key sign of recovering is that your critic begins to shrink and lose its dominance
over your psyche. As it shrinks, your user-friendly ego has room to grow and to develop the kind
of mindfulness that recognizes when the critic has taken over.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 876 (Number of characters: 104):
This in turn allows you to
progressively reject the critic’s perfectionistic and drasticizing processes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 877 (Number of characters: 64):
More and more, you
stop persecuting yourself for normal foibles.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 878 (Number of characters: 88):
Additionally, you perseverate less in
disappointment about other people’s minor miscues.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 879 (Number of characters: 76):
A further sign of recovering is a gradual increase in your ability to relax.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 880 (Number of characters: 87):
With this comes
an increasing ability to resist overreacting from a triggered position.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 881 (Number of characters: 335):
This further allows you to
use your fight, flight, freeze and fawn instincts in healthy and non-self-destructive ways. This
means you only fight back when under real attack, only flee when odds are insurmountable, only
freeze when you need to go into acute observation mode, and only fawn when it is appropriate to
be self-sacrificing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 882 (Number of characters: 141):
An alternative way of describing this decrease in overreacting is that you have a good
balance between the polar opposites of fight and fawn.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 883 (Number of characters: 138):
As this becomes increasingly realized,
you vacillate healthily between asserting your own needs and compromising with the needs of
others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 884 (Number of characters: 127):
A further example of decreased reactivity is seen in a more balanced movement between the
polar opposites of flight and freeze.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 885 (Number of characters: 176):
This manifests as an improving equilibrium between doing
and being, between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system arousal, and between left
and right-brain processing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 886 (Number of characters: 143):
The importance of balancing the fight-fawn and flight-freeze

polarities within yourself is explored in greater detail at the end of chapter 6.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 887 (Number of characters: 100):
Deep-level recovery is also evidenced by you becoming gradually more relaxed in safe
enough company.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 888 (Number of characters: 110):
This in turn leads to an increasing capacity to be more authentic and
vulnerable in trustworthy relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 889 (Number of characters: 174):
With enough grace, this may then culminate in you
acquiring an intimate, mutually supportive relationship where each of you can be there for the
other through thick and thin.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 890 (Number of characters: 118):
Advanced recovery also correlates with letting go of the salvation fantasy that you will
never have another flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 891 (Number of characters: 103):
Giving up the salvation fantasy is another one of those two steps
forward, one step backward processes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 892 (Number of characters: 141):
We typically have to wrestle with denial a great deal to
increasingly accept the unfair reality that we will never be totally flashback-free.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 893 (Number of characters: 168):
Unless we do
however, we impair our ability to easily recognize and quickly respond to flashbacks from a
position of self-compassion, self-soothing and self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 894 (Number of characters: 136):
The Stages Of Recovering
Although we often work on many levels of recovering at the same time, recovering is to some
degree progressive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 895 (Number of characters: 109):
It begins on the cognitive level when psychoeducation and mindfulness helps
us understand that we have Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 896 (Number of characters: 129):
This awakening then allows us to learn how to approach the
journey of deconstructing the various life-spoiling dynamics of Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 897 (Number of characters: 96):
Still on the cognitive level, we take our next steps into the long work of shrinking the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 898 (Number of characters: 167):
Some survivors will need to do a great deal of work on this level before they can move down to
the emotional layer of work which is learning how to grieve effectively.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 899 (Number of characters: 202):
The phase of intensely grieving our childhood losses can last for a couple of years. When
sufficient progress is made in grieving, the survivor naturally drops down into the next level of
recovery work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 900 (Number of characters: 79):
This involves working through fear by grieving our loss of safety in the world.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 901 (Number of characters: 101):
At
this level, we also learn to work through our toxic shame by grieving the loss of our self-esteem.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 902 (Number of characters: 155):
As we become more adept in this type of deep level grieving, we are then ready to address
the core issue of our trauma – the abandonment depression itself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 903 (Number of characters: 158):
Work here involves releasing
the armoring and physiological reactivity in our body to the abandonment depression via the
somatic work discussed in chapter 12.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 904 (Number of characters: 110):
This work culminates with learning to compassionately
support ourselves through our experiences of depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 905 (Number of characters: 201):
Finally, as we will learn more about in chapter 13, many survivors need some relational
help in achieving the complex tasks involved in deconstructing each layer of our old pain-
exacerbating defenses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 906 (Number of characters: 112):
Cultivating Patience With The Gradual Progression Of Recovery
As stated earlier, recovery from Cptsd is complex.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 907 (Number of characters: 127):
Sometimes, it can feel so hopelessly complex
that we totally give up and get stuck in inertia for considerable lengths of time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 908 (Number of characters: 205):
This is why it is
so important to understand that recovery is gradual and frequently a backwards and forwards
process. Effective recovery is often limited to only progressing in one or two areas at a time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 909 (Number of characters: 103):
Biting
off more than we can chew and trying to accomplish too much too soon is often
counterproductive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 910 (Number of characters: 133):
As a flight type, I spent years in mid-range recovery workaholically spinning

my wheels trying to fix and change everything at once.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 911 (Number of characters: 122):
I describe this at greater length in the
“When Recovery becomes Obsessive-Compulsive” section of my first book [p140-141].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 912 (Number of characters: 66):
We often need to simplify our self-help efforts in early recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 913 (Number of characters: 124):
Accordingly, I
recommend making shrinking the critic [chapter 9] your “go to” response if you feel unsure of
how to proceed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 914 (Number of characters: 172):
Once the critic is reduced enough that you can notice increasing periods of your brain being
user-friendly, impulses to help and care for yourself naturally begin to arise.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 915 (Number of characters: 95):
As this happens it
becomes easier to tell whether you are guiding yourself with love or a whip.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 916 (Number of characters: 179):
When you realize
it’s the whip, please try to disarm your critic and treat yourself with the kindness you would
extend to any young child who is struggling and having a hard time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 917 (Number of characters: 82):
Nowhere is patience with ourselves more important than with the inner critic work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 918 (Number of characters: 76):
Typically the
inner critic is too omnipresent to confront on every occasion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 919 (Number of characters: 53):
To do so would often leave no time
for anything else.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 920 (Number of characters: 189):
But when we practice critic-shrinking in a gradually increasing way over time, we can more
consistently disidentify from its negative focus and switch to a more self-supportive perspective.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 921 (Number of characters: 101):
Eventually a new positive habit of rescuing ourselves from shame and self-hate takes on its own
life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 922 (Number of characters: 91):
I still have my unfair share of flashbacks, but rarely do I ever side with my toxic critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 923 (Number of characters: 88):
Any self-help practices that we are trying to make second nature often work in this way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 924 (Number of characters: 77):
When we practice enough, self-help starts to become a matter of common sense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 925 (Number of characters: 162):
It reverberates
as right action and gradually takes on its own life as we attune to the true nature of our spirits
and souls which are inherently self-supportive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 926 (Number of characters: 146):
We also aid our recovery greatly by challenging the all-or-none thinking of the critic whenever it
judges us for not being perfect in our efforts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 927 (Number of characters: 90):
“Progress not perfection” is a powerful mantra for
guiding our self-help recovery efforts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 928 (Number of characters: 150):
Moreover as recovering progresses, and especially as the critic shrinks, the desire to help
yourself- to care for yourself - becomes more spontaneous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 929 (Number of characters: 97):
This is especially true when we
mindfully do things for ourselves in a spirit of loving-kindness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 930 (Number of characters: 192):
As such, we can do it for the
child we were – the child who was deprived through no fault of her own. And, we can do it
because we believe every child, without exception, deserves loving care.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 931 (Number of characters: 180):
Finally, if the reader is like I was in the past and has no overall perspective on his suffering,
he may feel like he is spinning his wheels on one icy patch of road after another.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 932 (Number of characters: 117):
I had decades of
trying everything under the sun with what felt like a deepening sense of futility and
defectiveness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 933 (Number of characters: 105):
Gratefully, I eventually reached an invisible critical mass, and realized I had
actually come a long way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 934 (Number of characters: 128):
I had acquired quite a few pieces in this puzzle of recovery, and only
needed to organize them into a map to move along further.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 935 (Number of characters: 167):
As such, I have designed a ground
plan that has helped me, my clients and website respondents to make sense of their suffering and
to see how to effectively reduce it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 936 (Number of characters: 77):
I hope and pray that the cartography in this book will also
offer you relief.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 937 (Number of characters: 115):
Surviving Versus Thriving
Recovery involves learning to handle unpredictable shifts in our inner emotional weather.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 938 (Number of characters: 88):
Perhaps the ultimate dimension of this is what I call the Surviving 
Thriving
continuum.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 939 (Number of characters: 301):
Before we enter into recovery, it may feel like life is nothing but a struggle to survive. However, when recovery progresses enough, we begin to have some experiences of feeling like
we are thriving. These may start out as feelings of optimism, hopefulness and certainty that we
are indeed recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 940 (Number of characters: 89):
And then, the bottom inevitably drops out because recovery is never all forward progress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 941 (Number of characters: 66):
Oh so unfairly, we are back to feeling that we can barely survive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 942 (Number of characters: 81):
To make matters worse, we are
amnesiac that we even had a respite from surviving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 943 (Number of characters: 87):
Another flashback has hit and we polarize
back onto the surviving end of the continuum.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 944 (Number of characters: 77):
We are stuck in the anxious and deadened feelings
of the abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 945 (Number of characters: 97):
In survival mode, even the most trivial and normally easy task can feel excruciatingly
difficult.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 946 (Number of characters: 47):
As in childhood, it is all feels just too hard.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 947 (Number of characters: 86):
And if the flashback is especially intense,
Thanatos may start knocking down the door.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 948 (Number of characters: 133):
Thanatos is the death urge described by Freud and
in a flashback it corresponds with the suicidal ideation we looked at in chapter 1.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 949 (Number of characters: 150):
Once again, it is important to repeat that this feeling-state is a flashback to the worst times
in childhood when our will to live was so compromised.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 950 (Number of characters: 162):
As mindfulness improves we can
recognize suicidal ideation as evidence of a flashback and begin to rescue ourselves with the
chapter 8 flashback management steps.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 951 (Number of characters: 128):
As recovery progresses, polarizations back into survival mode do not take us to the utter
despair end of the continuum so often.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 952 (Number of characters: 134):
Nonetheless survival mode can still feel pretty awful,
especially when it is characterized by high anxiety or immobilizing depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 953 (Number of characters: 179):
Being in survival is especially difficult during those times when flashback management is
less effective, and feelings that life is a struggle can hang on for days and even weeks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 954 (Number of characters: 71):
This is the
territory where flashbacks morph into extended regressions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 955 (Number of characters: 102):
I believe regressions are sometimes a call from our psyche to address important
developmental arrests.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 956 (Number of characters: 105):
In this case, it is the need to learn unrelenting self-acceptance during a
period of extended difficulty.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 957 (Number of characters: 81):
It is also the need to develop a staunch and unyielding sense of
self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 958 (Number of characters: 163):
This fundamental instinct of fiery willingness to defend ourselves from
unfairness needs to strengthen progressively so that we can withstand inner critic attacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 959 (Number of characters: 152):
Moreover we can grow in our ability to survive “survival” by using the chapter 13
mindfulness techniques to practice and build enduring self-compassion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 960 (Number of characters: 168):
Moreover, if we are far
enough along in recovery to have a safe ally, we can enlist their support to help us verbally
ventilate out our pain at being stuck in survival.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 961 (Number of characters: 126):
Temptations can be great at such times to revert to the less functional ways of self-soothing
that we learned when we younger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 962 (Number of characters: 133):
Depending on your 4F type this commonly manifests as
increased eating, substance abuse, working, sleeping and/or sexually acting out.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 963 (Number of characters: 149):
Sometimes we are triggered into self-medicating in this way because we are desperately
trying to keep ourselves on the thriving end of the continuum.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 964 (Number of characters: 119):
Desperately clinging to thriving is
a hard impulse to resist, even when we are in reality way past its expiration date.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 965 (Number of characters: 142):
Yet as recovery and mindfulness increase we begin to notice that this type of self-

medicating indicates that we are in a survival-flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 966 (Number of characters: 68):
We are no longer authentically on the
thriving end of the continuum.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 967 (Number of characters: 124):
We have compounded our regression, by regressing further - by
self-medicating to unnaturally prolong a preferred experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 968 (Number of characters: 174):
At such times, we benefit most by
reinvoking our intention to practice self-acceptance – by recommitting to being there for
ourselves no matter where we are on the continuum.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 969 (Number of characters: 128):
As bears repeating, all human beings are existentially challenged to handle disappointing
shifts out of thriving into surviving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 970 (Number of characters: 150):
We survivors however have greater difficulties handling
these transitions because we were abandoned for so long at the surviving end of the continuum.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 971 (Number of characters: 299):
Yet as our recovery progresses, we can learn to become increasingly self-supportive in times of
being stuck in survival.
Difficulties In Identifying The Signs Of Recovering
Some readers may work on their recovery for a long time, and erroneously and shamefully feel
they are not making any progress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 972 (Number of characters: 171):
Because of the all-or-none thinking that typically accompanies
Cptsd, survivors in the early stages of recovery often fail to notice or validate their own actual
progress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 973 (Number of characters: 127):
If we do not notice the degrees of our own improvement in our recovery work, we are in
great danger of giving up on recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 974 (Number of characters: 141):
Because of black-and-white thinking, we can regularly
fall into the trap of not acknowledging and valuing what we are actually accomplishing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 975 (Number of characters: 86):
Perfectionistic dismissal of improvement that is not 100% is common in early recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 976 (Number of characters: 140):
Here are some common areas where I see that recovering survivors fail to notice and self-
validate their progressive degrees of improvement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 977 (Number of characters: 2):
1.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 978 (Number of characters: 44):
Less intense launching into a 4F response
2.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 979 (Number of characters: 104):
Increasing resistance to the critic
3. Increased Mindfulness about flashbacks or inner critic attacks
4.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 980 (Number of characters: 52):
Increased time feeling good enough about yourself
5.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 981 (Number of characters: 64):
Progress in meeting arrested developments listed in chapter 2
6.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 982 (Number of characters: 60):
Decreased overeating or use of self-medicating substances
7.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 983 (Number of characters: 60):
Increased experiences of good enough relating with others
8.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 984 (Number of characters: 308):
Decrease in the painfulness and intensity of flashback feelings
In terms of number 3 above, it is important to note that even when mindfulness does not
immediately terminate a flashback or critic attack, noticing and identifying these Cptsd
phenomena is more progressive than just being blindly lost in them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 985 (Number of characters: 82):
Moreover, ongoing
recognition makes effective ameliorative action more accessible.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 986 (Number of characters: 102):
It makes us increasingly likely
to remember to use the flashback management steps listed in chapter 8.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 987 (Number of characters: 138):
Furthermore, it is important that we notice the gradually decreasing intensity of the
flashback feelings of anxiety, shame and depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 988 (Number of characters: 179):
In this regard, social anxiety can gradually
reduce along a continuum that stretches from panicky withdrawal... to a more tolerable social
discomfort... to periods of social ease.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 989 (Number of characters: 231):
Additionally, depression can gradually diminish along a
continuum that stretches from paralyzing despair... to anhedonia – an inability to enjoy normal
life pleasures... to a state of tired, and relatively unmotivated peacefulness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 990 (Number of characters: 88):
Of course both these

processes typically improve at a vacillating, back-and-forth rate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 991 (Number of characters: 155):
As I write this I feel some old sadness about the many decades that I judged my emotional
tone and mood as either good or bad in a very all-or-nothing way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 992 (Number of characters: 288):
If I was not feeling very good
than I felt as if everything was really bad. And since feeling very good is something most human
beings only get to experience a relatively small proportion of the time, my perception of feeling
bad became a much more dominant experience than was necessary.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 993 (Number of characters: 125):
In fact, mildly unpleasant
feeling typically morphed me quickly into feeling terrible via shame-tinged, all-or-none thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 994 (Number of characters: 285):
I am so grateful for the life-changing epiphany that lead me to trade in my old primary
aspiration of “Celebration” for my new one of “Serenity.”
Inner critic thought processes refute signs of progress whenever a new flashback occurs, no
matter how much less intense it is than before.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 995 (Number of characters: 166):
Every recurrence of feeling shame, fear or
depression is interpreted as proof that nothing has changed, even when there are increasing
periods of not being triggered.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 996 (Number of characters: 97):
The critic’s black-and-white assessment is: “Either I’m cured or I’m still hopelessly
defective.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 997 (Number of characters: 269):
And once you identify with your critic’s pronouncement of defectiveness, you are off
and spiraling downward into a full-fledged flashback - captured once again in the ice veneer of
toxic shame that freezes one in the Cptsd stranglehold of helplessness and hopelessness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 998 (Number of characters: 140):
Accepting Recovery As A Lifelong Process It is exceedingly difficult to accept the proposition – the fact – that recovery is never complete.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 999 (Number of characters: 356):
And although we can expect our flashbacks to markedly decrease over time, it is tremendously
difficult, and sometimes impossible, to let go of the salvation fantasy that we will one day be
forever free of them. Yet when we do not loosen our grip on the salvation fantasy, we remain extremely
susceptible to blaming ourselves every time we have a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1000 (Number of characters: 257):
Understanding this is so crucial
because recovery typically progresses in a process that has many temporary regressions. Moreover, most recoverees often have the unfortunate subjective experience that the temporary
regression feels as permanent as concrete.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1001 (Number of characters: 233):
This is especially true because of the interminability
feeling of flashbacks. When we flashback, we regress to our child-mind which was incapable of
imagining a future any different than the everlasting present of being so abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1002 (Number of characters: 102):
So how can we come to bear the knowledge that our awful childhoods have created some
permanent damage?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1003 (Number of characters: 348):
It helps me to see my Cptsd as somewhat analogous to diabetes, i.e., a
condition that will need management throughout my life. This is a piece of bad news that
naturally feels offensively unpalatable, but the good news, as with diabetes, is that as we become
more skilled at flashback management, Cptsd can gradually become infrequently bothersome.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1004 (Number of characters: 95):
And even more importantly, we can evolve towards leading increasingly rich and rewarding
lives.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1005 (Number of characters: 83):
Even better news is that Cptsd, when efficiently managed, eventually bestows gifts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1006 (Number of characters: 124):
It
comes with significant silver linings - unavailable to those less traumatized - as we will see at the
end of the chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1007 (Number of characters: 183):
Therapeutic Flashbacks And Growing Pains

Healing from childhood trauma is also a long gradual process because recovering your full self-
expression requires a great deal of practice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1008 (Number of characters: 59):
Being yourself can be intimidating and flashback-
inducing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1009 (Number of characters: 88):
Healthy self-assertion was punished like a capital crime in many dysfunctional
families.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1010 (Number of characters: 101):
Expressing yourself in ways that your parents forbade typically triggers intense
flashbacks at first.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1011 (Number of characters: 112):
This can cause you to lose sight of how this practice gradually reduces the
chronic pain of remaining invisible.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1012 (Number of characters: 105):
We can encourage ourselves to face these growing pains by conceptualizing them as
therapeutic flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1013 (Number of characters: 208):
We then choose to weather these flashbacks to stop the past from holding
us back, to reclaim the fundamental human rights that our parents denied us, and to finally own
what is rightfully ours for the taking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1014 (Number of characters: 130):
We can further bolster ourselves for such necessary flashbacks by comparing “speaking up”
to going to the dentist for a toothache.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1015 (Number of characters: 125):
Unless we accept the acute pain of the dentist’s
therapeutic procedure, we will suffer chronic dental discomfit indefinitely.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1016 (Number of characters: 75):
Unless we speak up,
the loneliness of our silence will imprison us forever.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1017 (Number of characters: 135):
Recovering from overwhelmingly painful childhoods is also so difficult because we
understandably want to avoid any further pain at all.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1018 (Number of characters: 78):
We may even believe that we need to risk a
flashback and practice speaking up.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1019 (Number of characters: 131):
But at the moment of facing the triggering that silence can so
easily avoid, we cannot sometimes help giving up and remaining mute.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1020 (Number of characters: 98):
However, if we are ever to recover our real voice, we must sometimes invoke the energy of
bravery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1021 (Number of characters: 43):
Bravery is, in my opinion, defined by fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1022 (Number of characters: 47):
It is taking right action despite being afraid.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1023 (Number of characters: 48):
It is not brave to do things that are not scary.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1024 (Number of characters: 73):
The anger work described in chapter 11 can help you with this enormously.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1025 (Number of characters: 141):
With a strong
enough intention you can begin by occasionally invoking the kind of courage that involves
feeling the fear and doing it anyway.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1026 (Number of characters: 108):
You can nudge yourself to do it to rescue your inner child
from the loneliness of never being seen or heard.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1027 (Number of characters: 145):
Moreover, when we embrace this practice we will eventually learn that fear does not have
to disabling. We can be afraid and still act powerfully.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1028 (Number of characters: 135):
We can refuse to tolerate never speaking
up, never having our say, never stating a preference, and never saying “no” to set a boundary.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1029 (Number of characters: 166):
With enough practice, therapeutic flashbacks not only diminish, but begin to be replaced by
a healthy sense of pride in ourselves for our courageous self-championing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1030 (Number of characters: 75):
More and more we
are rewarded with feelings of safe belonging in the world.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1031 (Number of characters: 155):
It is crucial for deeper level recovery that we learn that feelings of fear, shame and guilt are
sometimes signs that we have said or done the right thing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1032 (Number of characters: 101):
They are emotional flashbacks to how
we were traumatized for trying to claim normal human privileges.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1033 (Number of characters: 152):
As our recovery progresses, we need to learn to endure these feelings. Reinterpreting the
deeper meaning of these feelings is key to accomplishing this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1034 (Number of characters: 54):
Typically this involves epiphanies
like the following.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1035 (Number of characters: 66):
“I feel afraid now, but I am not in danger like I was as a child.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1036 (Number of characters: 147):
“I feel guilty
not because I am guilty, but because I was intimidated into feeling guilty for expressing my
opinions, my needs and my preferences.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1037 (Number of characters: 67):
“I feel shame because my parents rained disgust on me
for being me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1038 (Number of characters: 106):
I say no to these toxic parental curses, and I am proud and right to see how they
tried to murder my soul.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1039 (Number of characters: 198):
I give them their shame back as disgust – the disgust any healthy adult

feels when he sees a parent bullying a child with contempt, or when he sees a parent heartlessly
ignoring a suffering child.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1040 (Number of characters: 195):
Optimal Stress
The quest to ongoingly grow and evolve out of my childhood trauma sometimes becomes more
embraceable to me when I remember the poet’s words: “He not busy being born is busy dying.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1041 (Number of characters: 116):
In fact, some of the latest research in neuroscience suggests that we actually need a modicum of
stress in our life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1042 (Number of characters: 425):
This type of stress is called optimal stress. Optimal stress is the balanced, moderate amount of stress that appears to be necessary to
grow the new neurons and neuronal connections that correlate with keeping the brain healthy. Research shows that just as too much stress creates a biochemical condition that damages
neurons in the brain, too little stress leads to the atrophy, death and lack of replacement of old
neurons.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1043 (Number of characters: 196):
This is why lifelong learning is widely recognized as one of the key practices necessary
to avoid Alzheimer’s disease. In my opinion, lifelong recovering is an exalted subset of lifelong learning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1044 (Number of characters: 122):
I believe that
optimal stress is frequently attained when we practice the behaviors that remedy our
developmental arrests.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1045 (Number of characters: 241):
Examples of this include reading self-help books, attending self-
improvement workshops, working at deeper self-discovery through journaling, or struggling to
be more vulnerable and authentic in a therapy session or an evolving relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1046 (Number of characters: 81):
Moreover, it
might be that minor flashbacks sometimes function as optimal stress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1047 (Number of characters: 112):
I certainly know a number
of long term recoverees who seem to be evolving and becoming sharper in their old age.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1048 (Number of characters: 14):
SILVER LININGS

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1049 (Number of characters: 169):
We live in an emotionally impoverished culture, and those who stick with a long term recovery
process are often rewarded with emotional intelligence far beyond the norm.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1050 (Number of characters: 315):
This is somewhat
paradoxical, as survivors of childhood trauma are initially injured more grievously in their
emotional natures than those in the general population. The silver lining in this, however, is that many of us were forced to consciously address our
suffering because our wounding was so much more severe.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1051 (Number of characters: 174):
Those who work an effective
recovery program not only recover significantly from emotional damage, but also evolve out of
the emotional impoverishment of the general society.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1052 (Number of characters: 99):
One of my clients described this as
becoming “way more emotionally intelligent than the ‘normies’.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1053 (Number of characters: 277):
Perhaps the greatest reward of improved emotional intelligence is seen in a greater capacity
for deeper intimacy. Emotional intelligence is a foundational ingredient of relational intelligence
– a type of intelligence that is also frequently diminished in the general populace.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1054 (Number of characters: 111):
As stated earlier, intimacy is greatly enhanced when two people dialogue about all aspects
of their experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1055 (Number of characters: 88):
This is especially true when they transcend taboos against full emotional
communication.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1056 (Number of characters: 175):
Feelings of love, appreciation and gratitude are naturally enhanced when we
reciprocally show our full selves - confident or afraid, loving or alienated, proud or embarrassed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1057 (Number of characters: 109):
What an incredible achievement it is when any two of us create such an authentic and supportive
relationship!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1058 (Number of characters: 173):
Many of the most intimate relationships that I have seen are between people who
have done a great deal of freeing themselves from the negative legacies of their upbringings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1059 (Number of characters: 127):
“The Unexamined Life Is Not Worth Living”
A further silver lining in recovery is the attainment of a much richer internal life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1060 (Number of characters: 121):
The
introspective process, so fundamental to effective recovery work, eventually deepens and
enriches survivors’ psyches.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1061 (Number of characters: 160):
Ongoing mindful exploration of all aspects of our experience helps
us see firsthand what Socrates meant when he said: “The unexamined life is not worth living”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1062 (Number of characters: 230):
The survivor who follows the introspective “road less travelled” becomes increasingly free
of compulsive and unconscious allegiance to unhelpful familial, religious and societal values that
were instilled at an impressionable age.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1063 (Number of characters: 103):
The recoveree now gets to choose her own values and reject those that are not in her own
best interest.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1064 (Number of characters: 146):
She develops a deeper more grounded self-respect that is not contingent upon going
with the herd and shifting center with every new popular trend.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1065 (Number of characters: 115):
In psychological parlance, she
becomes free and brave enough to individuate and develop more of her full potential.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1066 (Number of characters: 75):
In Joseph Campbell’s words, the survivor learns to “follows his own bliss”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1067 (Number of characters: 76):
He is freer to
pursue activities and interests that naturally appeal to him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1068 (Number of characters: 39):
He evolves into his own sense of
style.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1069 (Number of characters: 100):
He may even feel emboldened to coif and dress himself without adherence to the standards
of fashion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1070 (Number of characters: 47):
He may extend this freedom into his home décor.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1071 (Number of characters: 129):
In this vein, I have seen many
survivors discover their own aesthetic, as well as an increased appreciation of beauty in general.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1072 (Number of characters: 195):
How this contrasts with many of the homes of my “normal” sports-buddies, whose homes are
often sparsely decorated, as if they are too afraid to put something out or up lest it not be cool
enough.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1073 (Number of characters: 171):
As the survivor recovers the right of free choice, she becomes more open to trying new
things – healthy things that mainstream society might consider uncool or even taboo.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1074 (Number of characters: 292):
Here are
some examples of this that I believe are conducive to both recovery and healthy everyday living:
voluntary simplicity, improved diet, meditation, alternative medicine, broad scale compassion,
environmentalism, deeper emotional communication and a broader use of the grieving process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1075 (Number of characters: 146):
The survivor who pursues long-term development on his journey of recovering generally
achieves greater overall evolution than the average citizen.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1076 (Number of characters: 160):
For many untraumatized people, the
pursuit of ongoing learning often stops after their last formal learning experience – whether that
is high school or college.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1077 (Number of characters: 119):
Introspective development also rewards the recoveree with more perspective and wisdom in
making important life choices.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1078 (Number of characters: 122):
It also improves his everyday instinctual choices, such as whether
to fight, flee, freeze or fawn in times of real danger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1079 (Number of characters: 164):
Finally, another silver lining, often achieved in later stage recovery, is a greater ability to handle
normal pain in the most healthy and least retraumatizing way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1080 (Number of characters: 171):
By normal pain, I mean the
recurring existential pain all human beings experience from time to time via encounters with
loss, illness, money troubles, time pressures, etc.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1081 (Number of characters: 97):
Such painful encounters can produce emotional
reactions like anger, sadness, fear and depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1082 (Number of characters: 109):
The average person has not learned how to
verbally ventilate and metabolize their feelings about such events.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1083 (Number of characters: 118):
This results in them getting
stuck in painful emotional places, especially depression, for inordinate amounts of time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1084 (Number of characters: 243):
The Emotional Imperialism Of “Don’t Worry, Be Happy”
One reason that recovering survivors attain greater emotional intelligence is that they eventually
see through the mainstream media’s indoctrination that people should be happy all the time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1085 (Number of characters: 152):
Much of the general populace, however, becomes increasingly dissociated from their full
emotional experience by anxiously pushing to pump up their mood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1086 (Number of characters: 95):
Many “normal” people strive
to fulfill the pursuit of happiness as if it were a patriotic duty.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1087 (Number of characters: 76):
More and more they employ
socially acceptable addictions to accomplish this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1088 (Number of characters: 117):
Snacking, spending, self-medicating, and
online puttering are widespread addictions that seem to be ever on the rise.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1089 (Number of characters: 199):
A particularly rampant example of unhealthy mood-altering behavior is porn addiction. Addiction to pornography creates a terrible narrowing of consciousness in the many men who are
afflicted with it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1090 (Number of characters: 54):
It commonly destroys their capacity for real intimacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1091 (Number of characters: 94):
Tragically, the use of
porn is more and more “normalized”, even in many psychological circles.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1092 (Number of characters: 335):
Here 
are 
two 
enlightening 
references 
on 
this 
latter 
subject:

and
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU.
As we become more emotionally intelligent, we free ourselves from the hysteria-inducing
pressure to continuously pump up the joy in our life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1093 (Number of characters: 48):
Please do not read this as an “Ode against Joy”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1094 (Number of characters: 77):
It is a blessing to have our natural fair share
of laughter and feeling good.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1095 (Number of characters: 117):
But I believe it also a blessing to resist the growing emotional
imperialism that demands we become fountains of joy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1096 (Number of characters: 265):
We are assaulted daily with messages
from advertisements, from laugh track-saturated TV shows, and from new age enlightenment
gurus who shame us into believing that we are “less than”, if we are not constantly bubbling over
with ecstatic Disneyland-like enthusiasm.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1097 (Number of characters: 78):
The pressure to be always up was an enormous shame trigger for me for decades.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1098 (Number of characters: 103):
Sadly, I
increasingly see clients and friends struggling with self-contempt for not being happy enough.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1099 (Number of characters: 124):
Once again, I am certainly not knocking joy, but when it is inauthentic, it is disconcertingly
sad and sometimes alienating.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1100 (Number of characters: 114):
In worst case scenarios, a controlling narcissist can emotionally
blackmail us to join him in falsely emoting joy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1101 (Number of characters: 95):
Just as painful is when we codependents force
ourselves to laugh to cover up our fear or shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1102 (Number of characters: 196):
This is also not to say that authentic joy cannot be contagious. Contagious joy is the
wonderful experience of being positively triggered into vicariously sharing someone else’s
authentic delight.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1103 (Number of characters: 89):
[For an experience of this, go to www.youtube.com and search for
“Quadruplets Laughing”].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1104 (Number of characters: 250):
In my experience, it seems that authentic joy is much more common in the lives of well
parented children. I also do not think that joy is typically as dominant an emotional theme in
adult life unless it is synthetically induced with drugs or alcohol.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1105 (Number of characters: 169):
On the other hand, experiences
of joy for survivors can gradually become more frequent as a person’s recovery efforts promote
increasing feelings of safety in the world.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1106 (Number of characters: 121):
As our emotional intelligence increases, I see considerable evidence that our expectations of
joy become more reasonable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1107 (Number of characters: 85):
This allows us to let go of permanent happiness as the unrealistic

goal of recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1108 (Number of characters: 118):
Until this happens, we remain at the mercy of the critic’s contemptuous
diatribes that we are not being joyful enough.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1109 (Number of characters: 142):
One of my clients recently became mindful enough
to see how he was shaming himself for not being as jubilant as those in the beer commercials.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1110 (Number of characters: 241):
As a concluding comment to this overview, it is important to emphasize that, like most things in
life, there are degrees of Cptsd. The continuum of Cptsd ranges from mild neurosis to psychosis,
and from highly functioning to non-functioning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1111 (Number of characters: 119):
Its severity ranges from having extended
periods without flashbacks to being in full flashback horror much of the time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1112 (Number of characters: 123):
This range also
varies from a condition of increased experiences of thriving to a condition of barely surviving
disability.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1113 (Number of characters: 133):
Progress in recovery is seen, then, in flashbacks becoming more manageable and life
satisfaction becoming continuously more frequent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1114 (Number of characters: 101):
A friend of mine once joked with me: “I’ve
got so much recovery, I’m beyond normal – I’m supernormal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1115 (Number of characters: 58):
I make the normies look like
they’re the ones with Cptsd.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1116 (Number of characters: 136):
As we end the overview, we are ready to move to the next chapter, which explains how varying
childhood trauma histories can cause Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1117 (Number of characters: 154):
Here we will also see how verbal and emotional
abuse alone can cause Cptsd, and how profound emotional abandonment is typically at the core
of most Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1118 (Number of characters: 63):
PART II
THE FINE POINTS OF RECOVERING

WHAT IF I WAS NEVER HIT?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1119 (Number of characters: 117):
Physical and sexual abuse are the most obvious traumas that a child can experience, especially
when they are ongoing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1120 (Number of characters: 83):
However, much that is also traumatic goes unnoticed in Cptsd-
engendering families.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1121 (Number of characters: 127):
This often occurs because parental acts of physical abuse are more blatant
than acts of verbal and emotional abuse and neglect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1122 (Number of characters: 134):
It appears to me that just as many children
acquire Cptsd from emotionally traumatizing families as from physically traumatizing ones.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1123 (Number of characters: 215):
Denial about the traumatic effects of childhood abandonment can seriously hamper your
ability to recover. In childhood, ongoing emotional neglect typically creates overwhelming
feelings of fear, shame and emptiness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1124 (Number of characters: 83):
As an adult survivor, you may continuously flashback into
this abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1125 (Number of characters: 114):
Recovering depends on realizing that fear, shame and depression are
the lingering effects of a loveless childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1126 (Number of characters: 142):
Without such understanding, your crucial, unmet
needs for comforting human connection can strand you in a great deal of unnecessary suffering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1127 (Number of characters: 60):
Denial And Minimization
Confronting denial is no small task.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1128 (Number of characters: 158):
Children so need to believe that their parents love and care
for them, that they will deny and minimize away evidence of the most egregious neglect and
abuse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1129 (Number of characters: 58):
De-minimization is a crucial aspect of confronting denial.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1130 (Number of characters: 103):
It is the process by which a
person deconstructs the defense of “making light” of his childhood trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1131 (Number of characters: 119):
The lifelong process
of de-minimizing the impact of childhood trauma is like peeling a very slippery and caustic
onion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1132 (Number of characters: 118):
The outer layer for some is the stark physical evidence of abuse, e.g., sexual abuse or
excessive corporal punishment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1133 (Number of characters: 133):
Subsequent layers involve verbal, spiritual and emotional abuse. Core layers have to do with verbal, spiritual and emotional neglect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1134 (Number of characters: 265):
In a perversely ironic way, my parents’ physical abuse of me was a blessing, for it was so
blatant that my attempts to suppress, rationalize, make light of and laugh it off lost their power in

adolescence, and I was able to see my father for the bully that he was.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1135 (Number of characters: 59):
[Seeing my idealized
mother’s abusiveness came much later].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1136 (Number of characters: 237):
Identifying my father’s behavior as abusive eventually helped me become aware of less
blatant aspects of my parents’ oppression, and I subsequently discovered the verbal and
emotional abuse layer of the onion of my childhood abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1137 (Number of characters: 27):
Verbal And Emotional Abuse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1138 (Number of characters: 207):
The fact that verbal and emotional abuse can be traumatic is lost on many childhood trauma
victims, though it is rarely lost on recovering victims of cult brainwashing who also are prone to
developing Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1139 (Number of characters: 95):
Many survivors of verbal and emotional abuse never learn to validate its soul-damaging
effects.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1140 (Number of characters: 58):
They never accurately assign current time suffering to it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1141 (Number of characters: 159):
Attempts to acknowledge it are
typically blindsided with thoughts that it was nothing compared to kids who were repeatedly
beaten – who “had it so much worse.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1142 (Number of characters: 119):
As a child, I minimized my father’s frequent face-slapping
by comparing it to my friend’s father who used to punch him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1143 (Number of characters: 149):
Much later, however, I finally realized that for me, and many of my clients, verbal and
emotional abuse damaged us much more than our physical abuse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1144 (Number of characters: 158):
Ongoing assault with critical words systematically destroys our self-esteem and replaces it
with a toxic inner critic that incessantly judges us as defective.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1145 (Number of characters: 105):
Even worse, words that are
emotionally poisoned with contempt infuse the child with fear and toxic shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1146 (Number of characters: 119):
Fear and shame
condition him to refrain from asking for attention, from expressing himself in ways that draw
attention.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1147 (Number of characters: 85):
Before long, he learns to refrain from seeking any kind of help or connection at all.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1148 (Number of characters: 191):
Theoretical Neurobiology Of The Critic
Unrelenting criticism, especially when it is ground in with parental rage and scorn, is so injurious
that it changes the structure of the child’s brain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1149 (Number of characters: 125):
Repeated messages of disdain are internalized and adopted by the child, who eventually
repeats them over and over to himself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1150 (Number of characters: 104):
Incessant repetitions result in the construction of thick
neural pathways of self-hate and self-disgust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1151 (Number of characters: 105):
Over time a self-hate response attaches to more and
more of the child’s thoughts, feelings and behaviors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1152 (Number of characters: 127):
Eventually, any inclination toward authentic or vulnerable self-expression activates internal
neural networks of self-loathing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1153 (Number of characters: 139):
The child is forced to exist in a crippling state of self-attack,
which eventually becomes the equivalent of full-fledged self-abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1154 (Number of characters: 76):
The ability to
support himself or take his own side in any way is decimated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1155 (Number of characters: 155):
With ongoing parental reinforcement, these neural pathways expand into a large complex
network that becomes an Inner Critic that dominates mental activity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1156 (Number of characters: 94):
The inner critic’s negative
perspective creates many programs of self-rejecting perfectionism.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1157 (Number of characters: 74):
At the same time, it obsesses
about danger and catastrophizes incessantly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1158 (Number of characters: 85):
Chapters 9 and 10 expand on shrinking and
deconstructing these life-ruining programs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1159 (Number of characters: 116):
Until this is accomplished, the survivor typically
lives in varying degrees of emotional flashback much of the time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1160 (Number of characters: 86):
The verbal and emotional layer of the abuse onion has many sub-layers of minimization.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1161 (Number of characters: 192):
I
have heard clients jokingly repeat numerous versions of this over and over: “I know I’m hard on

myself, but if I don’t constantly kick my own ass, I’ll be more of a loser than I already am.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1162 (Number of characters: 82):
In
fact, I really need you to come down on me if I try to get away with anything!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1163 (Number of characters: 159):
A childhood rife
with verbal and emotional abuse forces the child to so thoroughly identify with the critic, that it
is as if the critic is his whole identity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1164 (Number of characters: 61):
Disidentification from the critic is the fight of a lifetime.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1165 (Number of characters: 107):
To liberate your identity from the
toxic critic, you will have to repetitively confront it for a long time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1166 (Number of characters: 134):
You will have greater
success if you are prepared to forgive yourself for repeatedly collapsing back into the old habit of
self-blame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1167 (Number of characters: 52):
Progress is always a gradual back and forth process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1168 (Number of characters: 161):
Ironically, a pernicious type of
self-hate can constellate around the self-judgment that one is especially defective because she
cannot simply banish the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1169 (Number of characters: 62):
This is the typical toxic, all-or-none thinking of the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1170 (Number of characters: 112):
Sadly, many survivors give up on fighting the critic before recognizing the myriad subtle
ways it tortures them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1171 (Number of characters: 109):
Yet, there is no more noble recovery battle than that which gradually frees
the psyche from critic dominance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1172 (Number of characters: 107):
Until this happens to a significant degree, there is minimal
development of the healthy, user-friendly ego.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1173 (Number of characters: 85):
Let us look now at how emotional neglect alone can create a psyche-dominating critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1174 (Number of characters: 159):
Emotional Neglect: The Core Wound In Complex PTSD
Minimization about the damage caused by extensive emotional neglect is at the core of the Cptsd
denial onion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1175 (Number of characters: 133):
Our journey of recovering takes a quantum leap when we really feel and
understand how devastating it was to be emotionally abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1176 (Number of characters: 124):
An absence of parental loving
interest and engagement, especially in the first few years, creates an overwhelming emptiness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1177 (Number of characters: 114):
Life feels harrowingly frightening to the infant or toddler who is left for long periods without
comfort and care.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1178 (Number of characters: 146):
Children are helpless and powerless for a long time, and when they sense that
no one has their back, they feel scared, miserable and disheartened.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1179 (Number of characters: 139):
Much of the constant anxiety
that adult survivors live in is this still aching fear that comes from having been so frighteningly
abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1180 (Number of characters: 89):
Many survivors never discover and work through the wounds that correlate with this level.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1181 (Number of characters: 301):
This happens because they over-assign their suffering to overt abuse and never get to the core
issue of their emotional abandonment. As stated above, this is especially likely to occur with
survivors who dismissively compare their trauma to those who were abused more noticeably and
more dramatically.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1182 (Number of characters: 106):
I find this painfully ironic because some people suffer significant active
abuse without developing Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1183 (Number of characters: 98):
Typically, they are “spared” because there is one caretaker who
does not emotionally neglect them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1184 (Number of characters: 129):
Traumatic emotional neglect occurs when a child does not have a single caretaker to whom
she can turn in times of need or danger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1185 (Number of characters: 67):
Cptsd then sets in to the degree that there is no
alternative adult

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1186 (Number of characters: 86):
[relative, older sibling, neighbor, or teacher] to turn to for comfort and
protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1187 (Number of characters: 98):
This is especially true when the abandonment occurs 24/7, 365 days a year for the
first few years.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1188 (Number of characters: 215):
Growing up emotionally neglected is like nearly dying of thirst outside the fenced off
fountain of a parent’s warmth and interest. Emotional neglect makes children feel worthless,
unlovable and excruciatingly empty.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1189 (Number of characters: 76):
It leaves them with a hunger that gnaws deeply at the center
of their being.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1190 (Number of characters: 41):
They starve for human warmth and comfort.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1191 (Number of characters: 370):
The Failure To Thrive Syndrome
When a child is continuously deprived of a nurturing caretaker, love-starvation steadily increases
and sometimes devolves into the Failure to Thrive Syndrome. Failure to thrive is a term coined in the mid twentieth century to describe the epidemic of
baby deaths that occurred when new germ-phobic practices were introduced into hospitals.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1192 (Number of characters: 100):
The
new standard was that nurses were prohibited from holding babies for fear of contaminating
them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1193 (Number of characters: 44):
Infant mortality immediately began to climb.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1194 (Number of characters: 104):
Modern medical practice has abandoned this heartless approach because of the Failure to
thrive research.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1195 (Number of characters: 162):
This research has since been corroborated by data from Eastern European
orphanages where there are insufficient staff to meet the contact-comfort needs of babies.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1196 (Number of characters: 142):
Modern medicine now accepts as scientific fact the principle that babies need a great deal of
physical touch and nurturing in order to thrive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1197 (Number of characters: 149):
In my experience, failure to thrive is not an all-or-none phenomenon, but rather a
continuum that stretches from the abandonment depression to death.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1198 (Number of characters: 45):
Many Cptsd survivors never
thrived as babies.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1199 (Number of characters: 108):
I believe that many suffered painful bouts of lingering near the end of the
continuum that feels death-like.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1200 (Number of characters: 113):
Several of my clients commonly have quipped that they “feel
like death warmed over” when they are in a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1201 (Number of characters: 81):
Moreover, I suspect that some traumatized children do die from their abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1202 (Number of characters: 80):
Perhaps, their immune systems weaken and make them more susceptible to diseases.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1203 (Number of characters: 114):
Perhaps, as
David Kalshed hints, they unconsciously gravitate toward lethal “accidents” to terminate their
misery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1204 (Number of characters: 107):
One of my clients reported this painful memory when we were processing a flashback that
she was trapped in.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1205 (Number of characters: 76):
She was ten, in a daze, and walked out between two parked cars into traffic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1206 (Number of characters: 77):
She was hit by a truck and it took months of hospitalization to save her leg.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1207 (Number of characters: 156):
Her most tearful re-
experiencing of this event was remembering how she woke up in the hospital and felt
tremendous disappointment that she was still alive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1208 (Number of characters: 451):
Emotional Hunger And Addiction
The emotional hunger that comes from parental abandonment often morphs over time into an
insatiable appetite for substances and/or addictive processes. Minimization of early abandonment
often transforms later in life into the minimizing that some survivors use to rationalize their
substance and process addictions. Fortunately, many survivors eventually come to see their
substance or process addictions as problematic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1209 (Number of characters: 138):
But many also minimize the deleterious effects
of their addiction and jokingly dismiss their need to end or reduce their reliance on them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1210 (Number of characters: 196):
When the survivor has no understanding of the effects of trauma or no memory of being
traumatized, addictions are often understandable, misplaced attempts to regulate painful
emotional flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1211 (Number of characters: 94):
However many survivors are now in a position to see how self-destructive
their addictions are.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1212 (Number of characters: 65):
They are now old enough to learn healthier ways of self-soothing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1213 (Number of characters: 108):
Accordingly, substance and process addictions can be seen as misguided attempts to distract
from inner pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1214 (Number of characters: 162):
The desire to reduce such habits can therefore be used as motivation to learn the
more sophisticated forms of self-soothing that Cptsd recovery work has to offer.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1215 (Number of characters: 106):
As we will see in chapter 11, grieving work offers us irreplaceable tools for working

through inner pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1216 (Number of characters: 79):
This then helps obviate the need to harmfully distract ourselves from our
pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1217 (Number of characters: 147):
The Evolutionary Basis Of Attachment Needs
The human brain evolved during the Hunter-Gatherer era that represents 99.8% of our time on
this planet.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1218 (Number of characters: 271):
For a child, safety from predators during these times depended on being in very close
proximity to an adult. Even the briefest loss of contact with a parental figure could trigger
panicky feelings as beasts of prey only needed seconds to snatch away an unprotected child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1219 (Number of characters: 258):
Fear hard-wired in the child as a healthy response to separation from a protective adult. Fear
also linked automatically with the fight response so that the infant and toddler would
automatically cry angrily for attention, help, and cessation of abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1220 (Number of characters: 183):
Cptsd-inducing families however loathe angry crying, and many can find professionals to
back them up for routinely leaving babies and very young children to “cry it out” on their own.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1221 (Number of characters: 106):
In most dysfunctional families, parents disdain children for needing any kind of help or
attention at all.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1222 (Number of characters: 196):
Moreover, even the most well-intentioned parent can seriously neglect their
children by subscribing to the egregious 20th century “wisdom” that “Kids need quality time -
quantity does not matter.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1223 (Number of characters: 154):
When children experience long periods of being powerless to obtain needed connection
with a parent, they become increasingly anxious, upset and depressed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1224 (Number of characters: 74):
In Cptsd-engendering
families, the absence of care and concern is extreme.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1225 (Number of characters: 76):
A caretaker is rarely or never available for
support, comfort or protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1226 (Number of characters: 77):
If this is what you suffered, you then grew up feeling that no one likes you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1227 (Number of characters: 126):
No one ever
listened to you or seemed to want you around. No one had empathy for you, showed you
warmth, or invited closeness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1228 (Number of characters: 69):
No one cared about what you thought, felt, did, wanted or dreamed
of.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1229 (Number of characters: 165):
You learned early that, no matter how hurt, alienated, or terrified you were, turning to a
parent would do nothing more than exacerbate your experience of rejection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1230 (Number of characters: 247):
When caretakers turn their backs on a child’s need for help and support, her inner world
becomes an increasingly nightmarish amalgam of fear, shame and depression. The child who is
abandoned in this way experiences the world as a terrifying place.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1231 (Number of characters: 162):
Over time the child’s dominant experience of herself is so replete with emotional pain and
so unmanageable that that she has to dissociate, self-medicate, act out

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1232 (Number of characters: 88):
[aggression against others]
or act in [aggression against the self] to distract from it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1233 (Number of characters: 180):
The situation of the abandoned child further deteriorates as an extended absence of warmth
and protection gives rise to the cancerous growth of the inner critic as described above.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1234 (Number of characters: 312):
The child
projects his hope for being accepted onto self-perfection. By the time the child is becoming self-
reflective, cognitions start to arise that sound like this: “I’m so despicable, worthless, unlovable,
and ugly; maybe my parents would love me if I could make myself like those perfect kids I see
on TV.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1235 (Number of characters: 90):
In this way, the child becomes hyperaware of imperfections and strives to become flawless.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1236 (Number of characters: 113):
Eventually she roots out the ultimate flaw – the mortal sin of wanting or asking for her parents’
time or energy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1237 (Number of characters: 222):
Intrinsic to this process is noticing – more and more hyper-vigilantly - how her
parents turn their back or become angry or disgusted whenever she needs anything, whether it be
attention, listening, interest, or affection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1238 (Number of characters: 107):
Emotional neglect, alone, causes children to abandon themselves, and to give up on the
formation of a self.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1239 (Number of characters: 141):
They do so to preserve an illusion of connection with the parent and to
protect themselves from the danger of losing that tenuous connection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1240 (Number of characters: 158):
This typically requires a
great deal of self-abdication, e.g., the forfeiture of self-esteem, self-confidence, self-care, self-
interest, and self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1241 (Number of characters: 196):
Moreover, endangerment programs proliferate in the critic as the child learns that he cannot
ask his parent to protect him from dangers and injustices in the outside world, never mind in the
home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1242 (Number of characters: 76):
His only recourse is to become hypervigilant about things that can go wrong.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1243 (Number of characters: 111):
His critic
compiles lists of possible calamities, especially those that are graphically portrayed in the media.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1244 (Number of characters: 75):
The media gives the critic of the abandoned child much fodder to play with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1245 (Number of characters: 92):
She may be
exposed daily to hours of programs that glorify sarcasm, backbiting and bullying.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1246 (Number of characters: 152):
Moreover
news programs, with a ninety percent content of bad news, fill her head with impressions that the
world is predominantly hostile and dangerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1247 (Number of characters: 113):
Even worse, emotionally neglectful parents
commonly abandon their children to their favorite babysitter – the TV.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1248 (Number of characters: 300):
Through such neglect the child’s consciousness eventually becomes overwhelmed with the
processes of drasticizing and catastrophizing. Drasticizing and catastrophizing are critic
processes that lead the child to constantly rehearse fearful scenarios in a vain attempt to prepare
himself for the worst.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1249 (Number of characters: 166):
This is the process by which Cptsd with its overdeveloped stress and toxic
shame programs sets in and becomes triggerable by a plethora of normally innocuous stimuli.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1250 (Number of characters: 124):
Most notable of these stimuli are other people, especially unknown people or people even
vaguely reminiscent of the parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1251 (Number of characters: 198):
Over time, the critic comes to assume that all other people
are dangerous and automatically triggers the fight, flight, freeze or fawn response whenever a
stranger or unproven other comes into view.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1252 (Number of characters: 115):
This people-are-dangerous process typically devolves into the social anxiety that is
frequently a symptom of Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1253 (Number of characters: 70):
In worst case scenarios it manifests as social phobia and
agoraphobia.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1254 (Number of characters: 61):
In my opinion, agoraphobia is rarely the fear of open spaces.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1255 (Number of characters: 113):
It is instead a
disguised form of social phobia. It is the fear of going out lest you run into someone or anyone.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1256 (Number of characters: 219):
Abandonment Stultifies Emotional And Relational Intelligence
As stated above, emotionally abandoned children often devolve into experiencing all people as
dangerous, no matter how benign or generous they may in fact be.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1257 (Number of characters: 78):
Even love, coming their way,
reverberates threateningly on a subliminal level.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1258 (Number of characters: 196):
Unconsciously, they fear that if they
momentarily “trick” someone into liking them, the forbidden prize will vanish once their social
perfectionism inevitably fails and exposes their unworthiness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1259 (Number of characters: 97):
Moreover, when this occurs, they
will be triggered even more deeply into the abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1260 (Number of characters: 123):
Emotional intelligence and its cohort, relational intelligence, are forced into developmental
arrest by abandoning parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1261 (Number of characters: 95):
Children never learn that a relationship with a healthy person can
be comforting and enriching.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1262 (Number of characters: 103):
The ability to open to and benefit from love and caring from others
often lays dormant and undeveloped.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1263 (Number of characters: 138):
Moreover, the appropriate management of the normal emotions that recurrently arise in
significant relationships is never modeled for them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1264 (Number of characters: 104):
Emotional intelligence about the healthy and
functional aspects of anger, sadness, and fear lies fallow.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1265 (Number of characters: 202):
De-Minimizing Emotional Abandonment
As with physical abuse, effective work on the wounds of verbal and emotional abuse can
sometimes open the door to de-minimizing the awful impact of emotional neglect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1266 (Number of characters: 132):
I sometimes
feel the most for my clients who were “only” neglected, because it is so difficult to see neglect as
hard core evidence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1267 (Number of characters: 60):
Most people remember little before they were four years old.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1268 (Number of characters: 54):
And by that
time, much of this kind of damage is done.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1269 (Number of characters: 162):
It typically takes some very deep introspective work,
to realize that current time flashback pain is a re-creation of how bad it felt to be emotionally
abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1270 (Number of characters: 90):
The remembering and de-minimizing of the impact of emotional neglect can take a long
time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1271 (Number of characters: 64):
It is typically an intuitive piecing together of a lot of clues.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1272 (Number of characters: 87):
The puzzle is often solved when
a critical mass of childhood reconstruction is reached.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1273 (Number of characters: 96):
Sometimes this fosters an epiphany that
neglect is indeed at the core of present time suffering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1274 (Number of characters: 212):
Sometimes this epiphany brings a great
relieving certainty that fragile self-esteem, frequent flashbacks, and recurring reenactments of
unsupportive relationships were caused by the closed hearts of your parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1275 (Number of characters: 109):
I sometimes regret that I did not know what I now know about this kind of neglect when I
wrote my first book.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1276 (Number of characters: 74):
I wish I had not over-focused on the role of abuse in my childhood trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1277 (Number of characters: 180):
It is so hard to convey this to a client whose critic minimizes and shames them for their plight by
comparing them unfavorably to me: “I didn’t have it anywhere near as bad as you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1278 (Number of characters: 24):
My mother
never hit me!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1279 (Number of characters: 151):
How ironic that this typically invokes a feeling-sense in me that the worst thing that
happened to me, by far, was growing up so emotionally abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1280 (Number of characters: 259):
In fact, it was not until I
learned to assign the pain of numerous current time emotional flashbacks to the abject loneliness
of my childhood, that I was able to work effectively on the repetition compulsion that lead me
into so many neglectful relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1281 (Number of characters: 171):
And once again this is not to deny or minimize the C-ptsd-inducing traumatization that does
come from each and every type of abuse; physical, sexual, verbal and emotional.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1282 (Number of characters: 196):
Practicing Vulnerability
Emotional abandonment is healed by the type of real intimacy that we have been discussing. And
once again real intimacy depends on us showing up in times of vulnerability.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1283 (Number of characters: 192):
Deep-level
recovering occurs when we successfully connect with a safe enough other during the
flashbacked-times of feeling trapped in the fear, shame and depression of the abandonment
mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1284 (Number of characters: 78):
In this vein, I had to painstakingly practice showing up in my pain for years.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1285 (Number of characters: 43):
At first I could only
do this infrequently.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1286 (Number of characters: 151):
I was too habituated to my childhood default positions of hiding or
camouflaging with substances whenever I was in the grip of the abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1287 (Number of characters: 132):
Yet I
drew strength to increase my practice from a growing distaste for the social perfectionism of my
people-pleasing codependence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1288 (Number of characters: 184):
I somehow knew my loneliness would never decrease unless I
took the risk to see if certain well chosen others would accept me in all aspects of my experience,

not just the shiny ones.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1289 (Number of characters: 135):
And of course, like most survivors, I was ignorant at first that I was even experiencing the
emotional pain of the abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1290 (Number of characters: 32):
How could I help but conceal it?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1291 (Number of characters: 598):
Moreover, even after considerable de-minimization of my childhood abuse/neglect picture,
I was still convinced that everyone but my therapist would find me abhorrent if I shared about
my flashback feelings. Furthermore, my trust of my therapist also wavered quite a bit at first,
especially during my deepest flashbacks. Gratefully, sufficient positive experiences with my therapist eventually emboldened me to
bring my authentic vulnerability to other select and gradually proven relationships, where I found
the acceptance, safety and support that, previously, I would not have known to wish for.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1292 (Number of characters: 50):
There are limitations of the analogy of the onion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1293 (Number of characters: 81):
Later recovery does typically involve working
at various levels at the same time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1294 (Number of characters: 38):
De-minimization is a lifetime process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1295 (Number of characters: 113):
Revisiting a central
issue of our abandonment picture sometimes impacts us even more deeply than it did at first.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1296 (Number of characters: 178):
One such occasion left me reeling with the certain knowledge that getting hit felt preferable
to being abandoned for long hours outside my depressed mother’s locked bedroom door.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1297 (Number of characters: 107):
I would
pound on the door even though I knew she would explode because I just could not bear the
isolation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1298 (Number of characters: 117):
I have known about the latter for quite some time now and yet writing about it brings
up some new bitter-sweet tears.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1299 (Number of characters: 98):
Bitter-sweet tears are not uncommon in the ongoing work of peeling the layers of the denial
onion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1300 (Number of characters: 233):
The tears are bitter because we realize the abandonment was even more devastating than
we previously realized. And then the tears are sweet because they validate the truth of the
recollection and put the blame where it truly belongs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1301 (Number of characters: 156):
And then they may be bitter again because
the horrible abandonments happened over and over again when we were so young and
legitimately needed so much help.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1302 (Number of characters: 215):
And then they can turn sweet again, as in tears of gratitude,
because a person often comes through this kind of depth work with an enhanced compassion for
what she suffered and a healthy pride about having survived.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1303 (Number of characters: 526):
In my latest experience of this type of grieving my sweet tears came from realizing that I do
regularly experience good enough love and safety in relationship. And then my tears were bitter
again because I can still emotionally flashback to that bereft state of feeling stranded from the
comfort of others, even occasionally from my wife and son. And then my tears were sweet again
because my flashbacks are so much easier to handle these days, especially as I increasingly
master the use of the tools I describe in chapter 8.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1304 (Number of characters: 502):
The Power Of Narrative
There is also growing evidence that recovery from Complex PTSD is reflected in the narrative a
person tells about her life. The degree of recovery matches the degree to which a survivor’s story
is complete, coherent, and emotionally congruent and told from a self-sympathetic perspective. In my experience, deep level recovery is often reflected in a narrative that highlights the
role of emotional neglect in describing what one has suffered and what one continues to deal
with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1305 (Number of characters: 108):
My client, Matt, peeled a large layer off his onion of denial and minimization two days
before Mother’s Day.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1306 (Number of characters: 49):
He came into his session in a terrible flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1307 (Number of characters: 33):
“Life sucks and I suck
even more.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1308 (Number of characters: 72):
I couldn’t even do something as simple as pick out a Mother’s Day card.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1309 (Number of characters: 170):
Fortunately, Matt had achieved a great deal of de-minimization since the previous Mother’s
Day when he thought his mother was a good mother because she had never hit him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1310 (Number of characters: 128):
Now
however, he was heavily triggered by spending an hour in a card shop unable to find a card that
he could send to his mother.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1311 (Number of characters: 156):
As we explored this further, we discovered that the sentiments
written in every card made him feel like he would be betraying his inner child if he sent it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1312 (Number of characters: 91):
“I tell you, Pete, not one of those cards describes something that I could be grateful for.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1313 (Number of characters: 70):
I
don’t have one memory of anything nice she ever said or did for me!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1314 (Number of characters: 98):
Before long, he was deep
into grieving about how little mothering he had received from his mother.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1315 (Number of characters: 125):
He cried and angered about the scornful look and the sarcastic tone of voice that so
characterized his interactions with her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1316 (Number of characters: 65):
“Why did I have to get such a bad deal from the
mothering deck?!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1317 (Number of characters: 261):
Towards the end of the session, as often happens with healthy grieving, he felt his flashback
resolve and was restored to feeling like he was once again on his own side. The relief of being
out of the flashback also allowed his healthy sense of humor to return.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1318 (Number of characters: 84):
He started riffing: “I’m going to start a greeting card business for people like me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1319 (Number of characters: 72):
I’m going
to make a line of cards for people with dysfunctional mothers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1320 (Number of characters: 15):
How about this?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1321 (Number of characters: 406):
‘Thanks Mom
for never knowing what grade I was in’; or ‘Thanks Mom for all the memories of you walking
away whenever I was hurting’; or ‘Thanks Mom for teaching me how to only notice what was
wrong me’; or ‘Thanks Mom for teaching me how to frown at myself in self-disgust.’”
Understanding how profoundly derelict your parents were in their duty to nurture and protect you
is a master key to your recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1322 (Number of characters: 139):
You will benefit greatly from seeing emotional flashbacks as
direct messages from your child-self about how much your parents rejected you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1323 (Number of characters: 115):
When denial is
significantly deconstructed, you will typically feel genuine compassion for the child that you
were.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1324 (Number of characters: 186):
This self-compassion assuages emotional neglect by providing you with the missed
childhood experience of receiving empathy in painful emotional states instead of contempt or
abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1325 (Number of characters: 93):
This, then, helps you to reverse the childhood-survival habit of automatic self-
abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1326 (Number of characters: 245):
In turn, this can further motivate you to identify and address the many ways you
were abused and/or neglected. Chapter 8 of my book, The Tao of Fully Feeling, provides detailed
guidelines for assessing and remediating your abuse/neglect picture.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1327 (Number of characters: 115):
Finally, it is an empowering accomplishment to really get the profound significance of childhood
emotional neglect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1328 (Number of characters: 333):
It is often flashback-resolving to realize in the moment that a flashback into
bewilderment and hopelessness is an emotional reliving of your childhood trauma. Like nothing
else, this can generate a self-protective impulse toward your child-self and your present-time self,
kick-starting the process of resolving any given flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1329 (Number of characters: 130):
WHAT IS MY TRAUMA TYPE? This chapter describes a trauma typology for recognizing and recovering from the different types
of Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1330 (Number of characters: 66):
We human beings respond with some variability to childhood trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1331 (Number of characters: 151):
This model
elaborates four basic survival strategies and defensive styles that develop out of our instinctive
Fight, Flight, Freeze and Fawn responses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1332 (Number of characters: 141):
Variances in your childhood abuse/neglect pattern, birth order and genetics result in you
gravitating toward a specific 4F survival strategy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1333 (Number of characters: 79):
You do this as a child to prevent, escape or
ameliorate further traumatization.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1334 (Number of characters: 48):
Fight types develop a narcissistic-like defense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1335 (Number of characters: 58):
Flight types
develop an obsessive/compulsive-like defense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1336 (Number of characters: 49):
Freeze types develop a dissociative-like defense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1337 (Number of characters: 46):
Fawn types develop a codependent-like defense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1338 (Number of characters: 169):
Healthy Employment Of The 4 F’s
People who experience “good enough parenting” in childhood arrive in adulthood with a healthy
and flexible response repertoire to danger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1339 (Number of characters: 84):
In the face of real danger, they have appropriate
access to all of their 4F choices.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1340 (Number of characters: 129):
Easy access to the fight response insures good boundaries, healthy assertiveness and
aggressive self-protectiveness if necessary.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1341 (Number of characters: 155):
Untraumatized people also easily and appropriately access their flight instinct and
disengage and retreat when confrontation would exacerbate their danger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1342 (Number of characters: 146):
Untraumatized people also freeze appropriately and give up and quit struggling when
further activity or resistance is futile or counterproductive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1343 (Number of characters: 236):
Additionally, the freeze response is
sometimes our first response to danger, as when we become still, quiet and camouflaged to buy
time, to assess the danger and decide whether fight, flight, continued freeze or fawn is our best
option.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1344 (Number of characters: 208):
And finally, untraumatized people also fawn in a non-groveling manner and are able to

listen, help, and compromise as readily as they assert and express themselves and their needs,
rights and points of view.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1345 (Number of characters: 98):
A deeper elaboration of the origins of these four defenses is found
below and in the next chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1346 (Number of characters: 160):
POSITIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FOUR F’S
Those who are repetitively traumatized in childhood often learn to survive by over-using one or
two of the 4F Reponses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1347 (Number of characters: 158):
Fixation in any one 4F response not only limits our ability to access all
the others, but also severely impairs our ability to relax into an undefended state.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1348 (Number of characters: 73):
Additionally, it
strands us in a narrow, impoverished experience of life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1349 (Number of characters: 140):
Over time a habitual 4F defense also “serves” to distract us from the nagging voice of the
critic and the painful feelings that underlie it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1350 (Number of characters: 121):
Preoccupation with 4F behaviors dulls our
awareness of our unresolved past trauma and the pain of our current alienation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1351 (Number of characters: 70):
This chart compares the harmful behaviors of each defensive structure.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1352 (Number of characters: 115):
Real or imagined
danger typically triggers us into these roles and behaviors when we are in an emotional
flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1353 (Number of characters: 219):
DETRIMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE 4F DEFENSES
CPTSD AS AN ATTACHMENT DISORDER
Excessive reliance on a fight, flight, freeze or fawn response is the traumatized child’s

unconscious attempt to cope with constant danger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1354 (Number of characters: 88):
It is also a strategy to strengthen the illusion
that her parents really care about her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1355 (Number of characters: 72):
In adult life, all 4F types are commonly ambivalent about real intimacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1356 (Number of characters: 78):
This is because
closeness often triggers us into painful emotional flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1357 (Number of characters: 82):
It reminds us of how we had to
survive without comforting connection in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1358 (Number of characters: 149):
Our 4F defenses therefore offer protection
against further re-abandonment by precluding the type of vulnerable relating that leads to deeper
bonding.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1359 (Number of characters: 139):
A survivor also avoids vulnerable relating because his past makes him believe that he will
be attacked or abandoned as he was in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1360 (Number of characters: 78):
This is why showing vulnerability often
triggers painful emotional flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1361 (Number of characters: 122):
Many fight types avoid real intimacy by alienating others with their angry and controlling
demands for unconditional love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1362 (Number of characters: 101):
This unrealistic demand to have their unmet childhood needs
met destroys the possibility of intimacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1363 (Number of characters: 82):
Moreover, some fight types delude themselves into
believing that they are perfect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1364 (Number of characters: 56):
They see the other as the one who needs to be perfected.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1365 (Number of characters: 99):
This
defensive belief then entitles them to totally blame their partners for relationship problems.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1366 (Number of characters: 100):
Many flight types stay perpetually busy and industrious to avoid being triggered by deeper
relating.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1367 (Number of characters: 98):
Others also work obsessively to perfect themselves hoping to someday become worthy
enough of love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1368 (Number of characters: 83):
Such flight types have great difficulty showing anything but their perfect
persona.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1369 (Number of characters: 122):
Many freeze types hide away in their rooms and reveries fully convinced that the world of
relating holds nothing for them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1370 (Number of characters: 137):
Freeze type who have not been totally turned off relationships by
horrible childhood neglect or abuse, gravitate to online relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1371 (Number of characters: 80):
Online relating can be
pursued safely at home with as little contact as desired.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1372 (Number of characters: 101):
Many fawn types avoid emotional investment and potential disappointment by barely
showing themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1373 (Number of characters: 97):
They hide behind their helpful personas and over-listen, over-elicit and/or
overdo for the other.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1374 (Number of characters: 132):
By over-focusing on their partners, they then do not have to risk real self-
exposure and the possibility of deeper level rejection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1375 (Number of characters: 73):
This chart compares and contrasts the differences between the four types.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1376 (Number of characters: 161):
4F DISTORTIONS OF ATTACHMENT AND SAFETY INSTINCTS
Now let us examine each of the 4F defenses more closely with a view toward decreasing our
overreliance on them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1377 (Number of characters: 173):
THE FIGHT TYPE AND THE NARCISSISTIC DEFENSE
Fight types are unconsciously driven by the belief that power and control can create safety,
assuage abandonment and secure love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1378 (Number of characters: 238):
Children who are spoiled and given insufficient limits [a

uniquely painful type of abandonment] can become fight types. Children who are allowed to
imitate the bullying of a narcissistic parent may also develop a habitual fight response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1379 (Number of characters: 125):
Numerous fight types start out as older siblings who over-power their younger siblings just as
their parent over-powers them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1380 (Number of characters: 73):
Fight types learn to respond to their feelings of abandonment with anger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1381 (Number of characters: 122):
Many use
contempt, a poisonous blend of narcissistic rage and disgust, to intimidate and shame others into
mirroring them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1382 (Number of characters: 68):
Narcissists treat others as if they are as extensions of themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1383 (Number of characters: 89):
The entitled fight type commonly uses others as an audience for his incessant monologing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1384 (Number of characters: 96):
He may treat a “captured” freeze or fawn type as a slave in a dominance-submission relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1385 (Number of characters: 89):
The price of admission to a relationship with an extreme narcissist is self-annihilation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1386 (Number of characters: 87):
One of
my clients quipped: “Narcissists don’t have relationships; they take prisoners.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1387 (Number of characters: 74):
The Charming Bully
Especially devolved fight types can become sociopathic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1388 (Number of characters: 98):
Sociopathy can range along a
continuum that stretches from corrupt politician to vicious criminal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1389 (Number of characters: 190):
A particularly nasty
sociopath, who I call the charming bully, probably falls somewhere around the middle of this
continuum. The charming bully behaves in a friendly manner some of the time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1390 (Number of characters: 128):
He can even
occasionally listen and be helpful in small amounts, but he still uses his contempt to overpower
and control others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1391 (Number of characters: 72):
This type typically relies on scapegoats for the dumping of his vitriol.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1392 (Number of characters: 59):
These unfortunate
scapegoats are typically weaker than him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1393 (Number of characters: 122):
They may be members of a disenfranchised group: the
“ethnic” employees, the gays, women, his “problem” child or wife, etc.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1394 (Number of characters: 82):
He generally spares his
favorites from this behavior, unless they get out of line.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1395 (Number of characters: 140):
If the charming bully is charismatic enough, those close to him will often fail to register the
unconscionable meanness of his scapegoating.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1396 (Number of characters: 84):
The bully’s favorites often slip into denial,
relieved that they are not the target.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1397 (Number of characters: 69):
Especially charismatic bullies may even be admired and seen
as great.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1398 (Number of characters: 175):
Being the scapegoated child or spouse of such a bully is especially problematic because
it is so difficult to get anyone to validate that you were or are being abused by them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1399 (Number of characters: 99):
I remember how perplexed I used to be at photos of Hitler ostensibly acting kindly to his
children.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1400 (Number of characters: 129):
And I think as I write this of how many billionaires are venerated, and how most of
them stand up very poorly to closer scrutiny.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1401 (Number of characters: 70):
So many billionaires use sociopathic tactics to
accrue their fortunes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1402 (Number of characters: 199):
Examples of this are hostile takeovers, exploitive labor policies, health
destroying work conditions, devastating environmental practices and various other forms of
cheating, lying and back-stabbing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1403 (Number of characters: 118):
The “great” icon, Henry Ford, would regularly place new young workers at the front of his
“innovative” assembly lines.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1404 (Number of characters: 123):
The tired, used-up workers further down the line who could not
then keep up were unceremoniously ushered out the back door.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1405 (Number of characters: 220):
Labor unions eventually curtailed
that practice in this country, but many jobs have since been exported to unregulated third world
countries where workers labor in the same atrocious soul- and body-destroying conditions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1406 (Number of characters: 84):
And then, on a much less grand level, I remember a best friend I had in my twenties.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1407 (Number of characters: 188):
I

thought he was a great guy for almost two years until one day, shopping in the supermarket with
him, I witnessed his demeaning lambasting of an innocent checker just out of sheer spite.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1408 (Number of characters: 121):
Other Types Of Narcissists
Rageaholic narcissists are infamous for using other people as dumping grounds for their anger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1409 (Number of characters: 69):
They are addicted to the emotional release of catharting in this way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1410 (Number of characters: 100):
The relief often does not last
long before they are looking for another fix of venting their spleen.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1411 (Number of characters: 76):
This type of narcissism is pure bullying, and bullying alone can cause ptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1412 (Number of characters: 105):
If it goes on
long enough as it does with bullying parents in a dysfunctional family, it can cause Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1413 (Number of characters: 65):
If this
rings a bell with you, please check out www.nobully.com .

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1414 (Number of characters: 182):
Furthermore, and closer to a key theme of this book, I report the evidence of more than a
few clients who were horribly abused by their pillar-of-the-community, narcissistic parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1415 (Number of characters: 99):
Among them is my suave silent-type father, who regularly raged at and backhanded me and my
sisters.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1416 (Number of characters: 40):
He was much admired in our neighborhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1417 (Number of characters: 88):
A final example of narcissism is the charming narcissist who is not necessarily a bully.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1418 (Number of characters: 56):
I
call this type the narcissist in codependent clothing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1419 (Number of characters: 55):
My friend’s father is this type of charming
narcissist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1420 (Number of characters: 114):
When you meet him, he lures you in with questions and elicitation that make you feel
like he is interested in you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1421 (Number of characters: 113):
But, within a few minutes [once you have taken the bait], he
suddenly shifts into monologing like a filibusterer.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1422 (Number of characters: 131):
This particular type often masters the run-on
sentence and there is nary a pause to interject or even offer an excuse for escaping.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1423 (Number of characters: 80):
You have
become a captive audience and your release will not be procured easily.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1424 (Number of characters: 135):
Recovering From A Polarized Fight Response
I agree with the widely held notion that extreme narcissists and sociopaths are untreatable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1425 (Number of characters: 97):
Typically they are convinced that they themselves are perfect and that everyone else the problem.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1426 (Number of characters: 168):
Fight types who are not true narcissists, however, benefit from understanding the costly
price they pay for controlling others with intimidation, criticism and sarcasm.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1427 (Number of characters: 106):
Some who I
worked with eventually saw how their aggressive behavior scared away their potential intimates.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1428 (Number of characters: 216):
One survivor also realized that although her partner stayed, he was so afraid and resentful of her
demandingness and irritability, that he could not manifest the warmth or real liking that she so
desperately desired.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1429 (Number of characters: 137):
I have also helped a number of fight types understand the downward spiral of power and
alienation that comes from being over-controlling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1430 (Number of characters: 149):
It looks like this: excessive use of power
triggers a fearful emotional withdrawal in the other, which makes the fight type feel even more
abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1431 (Number of characters: 96):
In turn, he becomes more outraged and contemptuous, which then further distances
his “intimate”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1432 (Number of characters: 305):
This once again increases the fight type’s rage and disgust, which then creates
increasing distance and the withholding of warmth, ad infinitum. Fight types benefit from learning to redirect their rage toward the awful childhood
circumstances that caused them to adopt such an intimacy-destroying defense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1433 (Number of characters: 112):
This can help
them to deconstruct their habits of instantly morphing abandonment feelings into rage and
disgust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1434 (Number of characters: 136):
As the recovering fight type becomes more conscious of his abandonment feelings, he can

learn to release his fear and shame with tears.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1435 (Number of characters: 129):
I have helped several fight types by guiding them
to cry to release their hurt, rather than always polarizing to angering it out.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1436 (Number of characters: 117):
When we are hurt,
part of us is sad and part of us is mad, and no amount of angering can ever metabolize our
sadness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1437 (Number of characters: 140):
Fight types need to see how their condescending, moral high-ground position alienates others
and perpetuates their present time abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1438 (Number of characters: 135):
They must renounce the illusion of their own
perfection and the habit of projecting perfectionistic inner critic processes onto others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1439 (Number of characters: 76):
This is the
work of shrinking the Outer Critic as we will see in chapter 10.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1440 (Number of characters: 141):
Fight types also benefit from learning to take self-initiated timeouts whenever they notice
that they are triggered and feeling overcritical.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1441 (Number of characters: 203):
Timeouts can then be used to redirect the lion’s
share of their hurt feelings into grieving and working through their original abandonment, rather
than displacing it destructively onto current intimates.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1442 (Number of characters: 123):
Furthermore, like all 4F fixations, fight types need to become more flexible and adaptable
in using the other 4F responses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1443 (Number of characters: 118):
If you are a recovering fight type, it will especially benefit you
to learn the empathy response of the fawn position.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1444 (Number of characters: 82):
Begin by trying to imagine how it feels to be
the person you are interacting with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1445 (Number of characters: 25):
Do it as much as you can.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1446 (Number of characters: 152):
Moreover, you can expand on this
by developing mindfulness about the needs, rights and feelings of those with whom you would
like to have real intimacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1447 (Number of characters: 54):
In early recovery you can “fake it until you make it.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1448 (Number of characters: 161):
For without practicing consideration
for the other, and without reciprocity and dialogicality [as opposed to monologing], the intimacy
you crave will allude you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1449 (Number of characters: 135):
THE FLIGHT TYPE AND THE OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DEFENSE
Extreme flight types are like machines with the switch stuck in the “on” position.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1450 (Number of characters: 121):
They are
obsessively and compulsively driven by the unconscious belief that perfection will make them
safe and love-able.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1451 (Number of characters: 21):
They rush to achieve.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1452 (Number of characters: 61):
They rush as much in thought [obsession] as they do in
action

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1453 (Number of characters: 13):
[compulsion].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1454 (Number of characters: 93):
As children, flight types variably respond to their family trauma on a hyperactive
continuum.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1455 (Number of characters: 98):
The flight defense continuum stretches between the extremes of the driven “A”
student and the ADHD

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1456 (Number of characters: 62):
[Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder] dropout running amok.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1457 (Number of characters: 113):
Flight
types relentlessly flee the inner pain of their abandonment with the symbolic flight of constant
busyness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1458 (Number of characters: 121):
Left-Brain Dissociation
When the obsessive/compulsive flight type is not doing, she is worrying and planning about
doing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1459 (Number of characters: 81):
She becomes what John Bradshaw calls a Human Doing [as opposed to a Human Being.]

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1460 (Number of characters: 128):
Obsessiveness is left-brain dissociation, as opposed to the classic right-brain dissociation of the
freeze type described below.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1461 (Number of characters: 106):
Left-brain dissociation is using constant thinking to distract yourself from underlying

abandonment pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1462 (Number of characters: 96):
When thinking is worrying, it is as if underlying fear wafts up and taints the
thinking process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1463 (Number of characters: 147):
Moreover, if compulsivity is hurrying to stay one step ahead of your repressed
pain, obsessing is worrying to stay one level above underlying pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1464 (Number of characters: 111):
As a flight type myself, I sometimes find myself obsessively worrying through my outline
just before a lecture.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1465 (Number of characters: 97):
I do it, in part, to stay buoyant above my performance anxiety [a subset of
my abandonment fear].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1466 (Number of characters: 131):
In my early days of teaching I would also employ a compulsive defense
and pace as I anxiously searched my brain for a missing word.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1467 (Number of characters: 91):
Sometimes I would even scramble
frantically through the dictionary or thesaurus to find it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1468 (Number of characters: 92):
Unconsciously it was like I was
searching for a safe place beyond the gravity of my anxiety.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1469 (Number of characters: 72):
Flight types are also prone to becoming addicted to their own adrenalin.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1470 (Number of characters: 99):
Some recklessly
and regularly pursue risky and dangerous activities to jumpstart an adrenalin-high.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1471 (Number of characters: 91):
Flight types
are also susceptible to the process addictions of workaholism and busy-holism.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1472 (Number of characters: 92):
To keep these
processes humming, they can deteriorate into stimulating substance addictions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1473 (Number of characters: 87):
Severely traumatized flight types may devolve into obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1474 (Number of characters: 237):
Recovering From A Polarized Flight Response
The flight types that I have worked with are so busy trying to stay one step ahead of their pain
that introspecting out loud in the therapy hour is the only time they find for self-examination.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1475 (Number of characters: 105):
Learning about the 4F model often helps them to renounce the perfectionistic demands of the
inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1476 (Number of characters: 110):
I gently and repetitively focus on confronting their denial and minimization about the costs
of perfectionism.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1477 (Number of characters: 140):
This is especially important with workaholics who often admit their addiction
but secretly hold onto it as a badge of pride and superiority.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1478 (Number of characters: 68):
Flight types can get “stuck in their head” by being over-analytical.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1479 (Number of characters: 116):
Once a critical mass of
understanding Cptsd is achieved, it is crucial for them to start moving into their feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1480 (Number of characters: 86):
Sooner
or later, they must deepen their work by grieving about their childhood losses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1481 (Number of characters: 161):
Self-compassionate crying is an unparalleled tool for shrinking the obsessive perseverations
of the critic, and for ameliorating the habit of compulsive rushing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1482 (Number of characters: 141):
As her recovery progresses,
the flight type can acquire a “gearbox” that allows her to engage life at a variety of speeds,
including neutral.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1483 (Number of characters: 62):
Neutral is especially important for flight types to cultivate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1484 (Number of characters: 158):
If you are a flight type, there are a plethora of self-help books, CD’s and classes that can
help you learn to relax and decrease the habit of habitual doing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1485 (Number of characters: 120):
This is so essential because you
can get so lost in busyness, that you have difficulty seeing the forest from the trees.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1486 (Number of characters: 96):
This makes
you prone to prioritizing the wrong tasks and getting lost in inessential activities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1487 (Number of characters: 143):
When I am
triggered, I often feel pulled to busy myself with the simplest and easiest tasks, sometimes losing
sight of my key responsibilities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1488 (Number of characters: 140):
In flashback, flight types can deteriorate into chicken-with-its-head-cut-off mode, as fear
and anxiety propel them into scattered activity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1489 (Number of characters: 102):
Spinning their wheels, they can rush about
aimlessly, as if motion itself is the only thing important.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1490 (Number of characters: 141):
At such times the flight type can rescue himself from panicky flight by inverting an old
cliché into: “Don’t just do something, stand there.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1491 (Number of characters: 93):
And, by stand there I mean stop and take
some time to become centered - and to re-prioritize.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1492 (Number of characters: 68):
To accomplish this I recommend three
minute, mini-chair meditations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1493 (Number of characters: 108):
If you are a flight type, you can enhance your recovery greatly

by giving yourself a few of these each day.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1494 (Number of characters: 54):
You can start a chair meditation by closing your eyes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1495 (Number of characters: 104):
Gently ask your body to relax. Feel each of your major muscle groups and softly encourage them
to relax.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1496 (Number of characters: 26):
Breathe deeply and slowly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1497 (Number of characters: 135):
When you have relaxed your muscles and deepened and slowed your breathing, ask
yourself: “What is my most important priority right now?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1498 (Number of characters: 49):
What is the most beneficial thing I can
do next?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1499 (Number of characters: 134):
As you get more proficient at this and can manage sitting for a longer time, try the question:
“What hurt am I running from right now?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1500 (Number of characters: 73):
Can I open my heart to the idea and image of soothing
myself in my pain?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1501 (Number of characters: 128):
Finally, there are numerous flight types who exhibit symptoms that may be misdiagnosed as
Cyclothymia, a minor bipolar disorder.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1502 (Number of characters: 48):
This issue is addressed at length in chapter 12.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1503 (Number of characters: 44):
THE FREEZE TYPE AND THE DISSOCIATIVE DEFENSE

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1504 (Number of characters: 136):
The freeze response, also known as the camouflage response, often triggers a survivor into
hiding, isolating and avoiding human contact.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1505 (Number of characters: 125):
The freeze type can be so frozen in the retreat
mode that it seems as if their starter button is stuck in the “off” position.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1506 (Number of characters: 332):
Of all the 4F’s, freeze types seem to have the deepest unconscious belief that people and
danger are synonymous. While all 4F types commonly suffer from social anxiety as well, freeze
types typically take a great deal more refuge in solitude. Some freeze types completely give up
on relating to others and become extremely isolated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1507 (Number of characters: 74):
Outside of fantasy, many also give up
entirely on the possibility of love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1508 (Number of characters: 24):
Right-Brain Dissociation

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1509 (Number of characters: 134):
It is often the scapegoat or the most profoundly abandoned child, “the lost child”, who is forced
to habituate to the freeze response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1510 (Number of characters: 623):
Not allowed to successfully employ fight, flight or fawn
responses, the freeze type’s defenses develop around classical or right-brain dissociation. Dissociation allows the freeze type to disconnect from experiencing his abandonment pain, and
protects him from risky social interactions - any of which might trigger feelings of being
retraumatized. If you are a freeze type, you may seek refuge and comfort by dissociating in prolonged
bouts of sleep, daydreaming, wishing and right-brain-dominant activities like TV, online
browsing and video games. Freeze types sometimes have or appear to have Attention Deficit Disorder

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1511 (Number of characters: 6):
[ADD].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1512 (Number of characters: 107):
They
often master the art of changing the internal channel whenever inner experience becomes
uncomfortable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1513 (Number of characters: 118):
When they are especially traumatized or triggered, they may exhibit a schizoid-
like detachment from ordinary reality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1514 (Number of characters: 155):
And in worst case scenarios, they can decompensate into a
schizophrenic experience like the main character in the book, I Never Promised You a Rose
Garden.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1515 (Number of characters: 100):
Recovering From A Polarized Freeze Response
Recovery for freeze types involves three key challenges.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1516 (Number of characters: 60):
First, their positive relational experiences are few if any.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1517 (Number of characters: 114):
They are therefore extremely
reluctant to enter into the type of intimate relationship that can be transformative.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1518 (Number of characters: 53):
They are even
less likely to seek the aid of therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1519 (Number of characters: 96):
Moreover, those who manage to overcome this reluctance
often spook easily and quickly terminate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1520 (Number of characters: 61):
Second, freeze types have two commonalities with fight types.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1521 (Number of characters: 91):
They are less motivated to
try to understand the effects of their childhood traumatization.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1522 (Number of characters: 94):
Many are unaware that they have
a troublesome inner critic or that they are in emotional pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1523 (Number of characters: 116):
Furthermore, they tend to project the
perfectionistic demands of the critic onto others rather than onto themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1524 (Number of characters: 114):
This survival
mechanism helped them as children to use the imperfections of others as justification for
isolation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1525 (Number of characters: 58):
In the past, isolation was smart, safety-seeking behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1526 (Number of characters: 141):
Third, even more than workaholic flight types, freeze types are in denial about the life
narrowing consequences of their singular adaptation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1527 (Number of characters: 111):
Some freeze types that I have worked with
seem to have significant periods of contentment with their isolation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1528 (Number of characters: 173):
I think they may be able to
self-medicate by releasing the internal opioids that the animal brain is programmed to release
when danger is so great that death seems imminent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1529 (Number of characters: 152):
Internal opioid release is more accessible to freeze types because the freeze response has its
own continuum that culminates with the collapse response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1530 (Number of characters: 65):
The collapse response is an extreme
abandonment of consciousness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1531 (Number of characters: 77):
It appears to be an out-of-body experience that is the ultimate
dissociation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1532 (Number of characters: 214):
It can sometimes be seen in prey animals that are about to be killed. I have seen
nature films of small animals in the jaws of a predator that show it letting go so thoroughly that
its death appears to be painless.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1533 (Number of characters: 152):
However, the opioid production that some freeze types have access to, only takes the
survivor so far before its analgesic properties no longer function.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1534 (Number of characters: 59):
Numbed out contentment then
morphs into serious depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1535 (Number of characters: 105):
This in turn can lead to addictive self-medicating with
substances like alcohol, marijuana and narcotics.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1536 (Number of characters: 113):
Alternatively, the freeze type can gravitate
toward ever escalating regimens of anti-depressants and anxiolytics.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1537 (Number of characters: 156):
I also suspect that some
schizophrenics are extremely traumatized freeze types who dissociate so thoroughly that they
cannot find their way back to reality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1538 (Number of characters: 138):
Several of my freeze type respondents highly recommend a self-help book by Suzette Boon,
entitled Coping with Trauma-related Dissociation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1539 (Number of characters: 89):
This book is filled with very helpful work
sheets that are powerful tools for recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1540 (Number of characters: 182):
More than any other type, the freeze type usually requires a therapeutic relationship,
because their isolation prevents them from discovering relational healing through a friendship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1541 (Number of characters: 193):
That said, I know of some instances where good enough relational healing has come through pets
and the safer distant type of human healing that can be found in books and online internet
groups.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1542 (Number of characters: 96):
Phyllis, a self-proclaimed couch potato, began therapy with me with a great deal of ambivalence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1543 (Number of characters: 113):
Her third brand of anti-depressants no longer worked and her daily pot use was making her

increasingly paranoid.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1544 (Number of characters: 58):
Fantasies of dying were becoming more frequent and morbid.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1545 (Number of characters: 88):
She told
me: “I know therapy won’t help, but I’m afraid my husband is going to leave me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1546 (Number of characters: 35):
He says I’m
starting to scare him.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1547 (Number of characters: 145):
Phyllis managed being married because her husband paid the bills and left her alone with
her TV shows, science fiction books and online browsing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1548 (Number of characters: 90):
Additionally he was a workaholic,
rarely around and gone in the computer when he was home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1549 (Number of characters: 73):
In our therapy, trust building was a long gradual back and forth process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1550 (Number of characters: 71):
This is not un
common with many survivors, regardless of their 4F type.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1551 (Number of characters: 92):
Phyllis’s dark sense of humor was a saving grace, and helped her weather my
psychoeducation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1552 (Number of characters: 109):
She frequently met my attempts to link her current suffering and her awful
childhood with sarcastic rebuttal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1553 (Number of characters: 71):
Fortunately, growing up in New York gave me some resilience
to sarcasm.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1554 (Number of characters: 98):
I was willing to weather her sardonic sense of humor because there was no mean
spiritedness in it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1555 (Number of characters: 94):
Eventually I was able to help her direct the angry part of her sarcasm at her bullying family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1556 (Number of characters: 76):
With that, my psychoeducation finally began to seep in with a ring of truth.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1557 (Number of characters: 152):
She gradually began
to angrily vent about her father’s sexual abuse, her mother’s silent collusion, and all of the family
using her for target practice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1558 (Number of characters: 102):
This in time morphed into crying which rewarded her with her first
ever experience of self-compassion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1559 (Number of characters: 144):
It was not until we reached this stage, some years into the therapy, that Phyllis got a
glimpse of the vicious inner critic that persecuted her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1560 (Number of characters: 57):
Prior to this she rebuffed my “critic
ravings” as absurd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1561 (Number of characters: 189):
When we progressed sufficiently with the inner critic, the same process
occurred with my hypotheses that she had a great deal of underlying fear and anxiety that was
keeping her housebound.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1562 (Number of characters: 69):
She laughed with a great deal of ironic amusement: “Look at me, Pete!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1563 (Number of characters: 18):
Nothing scares me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1564 (Number of characters: 64):
I am so relaxed that I can hardly hold my body up in this chair.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1565 (Number of characters: 5):
Jeez!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1566 (Number of characters: 32):
You
know I’m always nodding out.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1567 (Number of characters: 45):
My husband calls me ‘Mellow Yellow.’”[Phyllis

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1568 (Number of characters: 11):
is blonde].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1569 (Number of characters: 135):
A breakthrough eventually happened here when she passed a man on the sidewalk outside
my office that was a doppelganger for her father.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1570 (Number of characters: 59):
She came into the session on the verge of
hyperventilating.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1571 (Number of characters: 93):
As I helped her slow and deepen her breathing, she had a therapeutic flashback
in the office.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1572 (Number of characters: 77):
She had a horrifying memory of her father sneaking into her bedroom at night.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1573 (Number of characters: 74):
Much grieving then resolved this particular flashback to her sexual abuse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1574 (Number of characters: 54):
Phyllis’s denial shrunk significantly in this session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1575 (Number of characters: 70):
She really “got” that social anxiety was
imprisoning her on her couch.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1576 (Number of characters: 137):
Deep level recovery work then ensued from this point in time, and
culminated with Phyllis feeling emboldened enough to go back to school.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1577 (Number of characters: 42):
She went on to become
a medical assistant.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1578 (Number of characters: 84):
This in turn opened the door to her finding a meaningful place in the outside
world.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1579 (Number of characters: 125):
A key part of the meaningfulness was the healthy friendship that she developed with a
fellow worker who was also in recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1580 (Number of characters: 66):
The progression of recovery for a freeze type is often as follows.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1581 (Number of characters: 125):
Gradual trust building
allows the recoveree to open to psychoeducation about the role of dreadful parenting in his
suffering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1582 (Number of characters: 130):
This then paves the way for the work of shrinking his critic, which in turn promotes
the work of grieving the losses of childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1583 (Number of characters: 103):
The anger work of grieving is especially therapeutic
for freeze types as is an aerobic exercise regime.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1584 (Number of characters: 60):
Both help resuscitate the survivor’s dormant
will and drive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1585 (Number of characters: 122):
THE FAWN TYPE AND THE CODEPENDENT DEFENSE

Fawn types seek safety by merging with the wishes, needs and demands of others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1586 (Number of characters: 149):
They act as if
they believe that the price of admission to any relationship is the forfeiture of all their needs,
rights, preferences and boundaries.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1587 (Number of characters: 60):
The disenfranchisement of the fawn type begins in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1588 (Number of characters: 143):
She learns early that a
modicum of safety and attachment can be gained by becoming the helpful and compliant servant
of her exploitive parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1589 (Number of characters: 81):
A fawn type/codependent is usually the child of at least one narcissistic parent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1590 (Number of characters: 54):
The
narcissist reverses the parent-child relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1591 (Number of characters: 234):
The child is parentified and takes care of the
needs of the parent, who acts like a needy and sometimes tantruming child. When this occurs, the child may be turned into the parent’s confidant, substitute spouse,
coach, or housekeeper.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1592 (Number of characters: 67):
Or, she may be pressed into service to mother the younger siblings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1593 (Number of characters: 55):
In
worst case scenarios, she may be exploited sexually.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1594 (Number of characters: 57):
Some codependent children adapt by becoming entertaining.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1595 (Number of characters: 115):
Accordingly, the child learns
to be the court jester and is unofficially put in charge of keeping his parent happy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1596 (Number of characters: 117):
Pressing a child into codependent service usually involves scaring and shaming him out of
developing a sense of self.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1597 (Number of characters: 225):
Of all the 4F types, fawn types are the most developmentally arrested
in their healthy sense of self. Recovering From A Polarized Fawn Response
Fawn types typically respond to psychoeducation about the 4F’s with great relief.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1598 (Number of characters: 121):
This
eventually helps them to recognize the repetition compulsion that draws them to narcissistic
types who exploit them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1599 (Number of characters: 91):
The codependent needs to understand how she gives herself away by over-listening to
others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1600 (Number of characters: 144):
Recovery involves shrinking her characteristic listening defense, as well as practicing and
broadening her verbal and emotional self-expression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1601 (Number of characters: 190):
I have seen numerous inveterate codependents become motivated to work on their
assertiveness when they realize that even the thought of saying “no” triggers them into an
emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1602 (Number of characters: 142):
After a great deal of work, one client was shocked by how intensely he
dissociated when he contemplated confronting his boss’s awful behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1603 (Number of characters: 118):
This shock then
morphed into an epiphany of outrage about how dangerous it had been to protest anything in his
family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1604 (Number of characters: 118):
This in turn aided him greatly in overcoming his resistance to role-playing assertiveness
in our future work together.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1605 (Number of characters: 143):
With considerable practice, this client learned to overcome the critic voices that
immediately short-circuited him from ever asserting himself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1606 (Number of characters: 100):
In the process, he remembered how
he was repeatedly forced to stifle his individuality in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1607 (Number of characters: 105):
Grieving these losses then
helped him to work at reclaiming his developmentally arrested self-expression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1608 (Number of characters: 88):
Recovering from
the fawn position will be explored more extensively in the next chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1609 (Number of characters: 52):
TRAUMA HYBRIDS
There are, of course, few pure types.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1610 (Number of characters: 68):
Moreover each type is on a continuum that runs from mild
to extreme.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1611 (Number of characters: 51):
Most trauma survivors are also hybrids of the 4F’s.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1612 (Number of characters: 93):
Most of us have a backup
response that we go to when our primary one is not effective enough.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1613 (Number of characters: 87):
When neither of these

work, we generally then have a third or fourth “go to” position.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1614 (Number of characters: 34):
Here are some common hybrid
types.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1615 (Number of characters: 96):
The Fight-Fawn Hybrid
The Fight-Fawn type corresponds with the charming bully described earlier.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1616 (Number of characters: 93):
This type combines
two opposite polarities of relational style – narcissism and codependence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1617 (Number of characters: 83):
Narcissistic
entitlement, however, is typically at the core of the fight-fawn type.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1618 (Number of characters: 70):
This type, in the extreme,
can also be Borderline Personality Disorder

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1619 (Number of characters: 6):
[BPD].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1620 (Number of characters: 45):
She can frequently and dramatically vacillate

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1621 (Number of characters: 41):
[split] between a fight and fawn defense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1622 (Number of characters: 165):
When a fight-fawn type is upset with someone, she can
fluctuate over and over between attacking diatribes and fervent declarations of caring in a single
interaction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1623 (Number of characters: 111):
The fight-fawn is more deeply understood by contrasting him with the fawn-fight, described
in the next chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1624 (Number of characters: 139):
This fawn-fight type is also subject to vacillating during an emotional
flashback, but typically does so with less vitriol and entitlement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1625 (Number of characters: 111):
The fight-fawn also differs from the fawn-fight in that his “care-taking” often feels coercive
or manipulative.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1626 (Number of characters: 88):
It is frequently aimed at achieving personal agendas which range from blatant to
covert.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1627 (Number of characters: 107):
Moreover, the fight-fawn rarely takes any real responsibility for contributing to an
interpersonal problem.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1628 (Number of characters: 93):
He typically ends up in the classic fight position of projecting
imperfection onto the other.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1629 (Number of characters: 144):
This essentially narcissistic type is also different than the fawn-fight
in that entitlement is typically much more ascendant in the fight-fawn.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1630 (Number of characters: 68):
His fawn behavior is
typically devoid of real empathy or compassion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1631 (Number of characters: 96):
I have worked with several clients who were unfairly labeled borderline by themselves or others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1632 (Number of characters: 72):
I could however tell by the quality of their hearts, that they were not.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1633 (Number of characters: 127):
This was evidenced by their
essential kindness and goodwill to others, which they always return to when the flashback
resolves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1634 (Number of characters: 141):
They also exhibit this in their ability to feel and show true remorse when they hurt
another, as we are all destined to do from time to time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1635 (Number of characters: 118):
Unlike the true borderline who has a
narcissistic core, they can sincerely apologize and make amends when appropriate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1636 (Number of characters: 128):
Another variant of the fight/fawn is seen in the person who acts like a fight type in one
relationship while fawning in another.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1637 (Number of characters: 159):
An example of this is the archetypal henpecked husband
who is a tyrant at work, and who also stays at work to all hours because he so prefers the fight
stance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1638 (Number of characters: 80):
This type also occurs in reverse: monster at home and lovely lady at the office.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1639 (Number of characters: 97):
The Flight-Freeze Hybrid
The Flight-Freeze type is the least relational and most schizoid hybrid.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1640 (Number of characters: 53):
He prefers the safety of
do-it-yourself isolationism.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1641 (Number of characters: 68):
Sometimes this type may also be misdiagnosed as Asperger’s
Syndrome.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1642 (Number of characters: 125):
The flight-freeze type avoids potential relationship-retraumati-zation with an obsessive-
compulsive/dissociative “two-step.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1643 (Number of characters: 171):
Step one is working to complete exhaustion. Step two is
collapsing into extreme “veging out”, and waiting until his energy reaccumulates enough to

relaunch into step one.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1644 (Number of characters: 87):
The price for this type of no-longer-necessary safety is a severely
narrowed existence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1645 (Number of characters: 118):
The flight-freeze cul-de-sac is more common among men, especially those traumatized for
being vulnerable in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1646 (Number of characters: 83):
This then drives them to seek safety in isolation or “intimacy-lite”
relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1647 (Number of characters: 117):
Some non-alpha type male survivors combine their flight and freeze defenses to become
stereotypical technology nerds.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1648 (Number of characters: 50):
Telecommuting is, of course, their preferred mode.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1649 (Number of characters: 233):
Flight-freeze
types are the computer addicts who focus on work for long periods of time and then drift off
dissociatively into computer games, substance abuse or sleep-bingeing. Flight-freeze types are prone to becoming porn addicts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1650 (Number of characters: 110):
When in flight mode, they
obsessively surf the net for phantom partners and engage in compulsive masturbation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1651 (Number of characters: 106):
When in
freeze mode, they drift off into a right-brain sexual fantasy world if pornography is unavailable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1652 (Number of characters: 186):
Moreover, if they are in intimacy-lite relationship, they typically engage more with their
idealized fantasy partners than with their actual partner during real time sexual interactions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1653 (Number of characters: 81):
The Fight-Freeze Hybrid
These types rarely seek recovery on their own initiative.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1654 (Number of characters: 95):
A colleague of mine told me about a
fight-freeze type who was dragged into therapy by his wife.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1655 (Number of characters: 72):
She complained that she was lucky
to get ten words out of him in a week.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1656 (Number of characters: 90):
She was at the end of her rope and if therapy did not fix
him, she was filing for divorce.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1657 (Number of characters: 155):
The husband was a computer engineer who telecommuted and only left his home office for
bathroom breaks and meals which were eaten separately from his wife.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1658 (Number of characters: 103):
He bullied his wife into
providing these meals according to a written schedule that he e-mailed to her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1659 (Number of characters: 79):
My colleague’s initial “Hello” to the husband was met with a scowl and a grunt.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1660 (Number of characters: 149):
Intuitively,
she kept the focus off him as much as possible, but each delicate attempt to make connection
with him was rebuffed with sarcastic scorn.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1661 (Number of characters: 99):
“You expect me to fall for that phony smile?”;
“You’re not gonna shrink me with your psychobabble!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1662 (Number of characters: 175):
My colleague, who is the most compassionate, non-intrusive person I know, was not able to
crack the prickly fight shell that guarded this poor man’s extreme social withdrawal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1663 (Number of characters: 165):
No miracle
was performed, and my colleague said she was amazed in retrospect that he even lasted twenty
minutes before he left in a wake of hostility and resentment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1664 (Number of characters: 138):
I have met with fight-freeze types a few times in similar circumstances, i.e., they were
dragged into therapy under the threat of divorce.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1665 (Number of characters: 86):
Each was like the character in the famous poem:
“The Autocrat at the Breakfast Table.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1666 (Number of characters: 48):
The fight-freeze is a yin or passive narcissist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1667 (Number of characters: 97):
He demands that things go his way, but he is
not much interested in having any human interaction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1668 (Number of characters: 105):
No one gets to talk at the table, not even
him – unless of course someone needs to be put in their place.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1669 (Number of characters: 126):
The fight-freeze type is a John Wayne couch potato, dominating family life with foul
moods and monosyllabic grunts and curses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1670 (Number of characters: 92):
He is typically as untreatable as the extreme fight
types mentioned earlier.
SELF-ASSESSMENT

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1671 (Number of characters: 210):
I recommend that you self-assess your own hierarchical use of the 4F responses. Try to
determine your dominant type and hybrid, and think about what percentage of your time is spent
in each of the 4F responses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1672 (Number of characters: 131):
You can also assess where you lie on the relevant continuums that stretch between the two
extremes in each line of the chart below.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1673 (Number of characters: 205):
Continuums of Positive and Negative 4F Responses
Fight: Assertiveness 
 Bullying
Flight: Efficiency 
 Driven-ness
Freeze: Peacefulness 
 Catatonia
Fawn: Helpfulness 
 Servitude
Recovery And Self-Assessment

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1674 (Number of characters: 100):
As stated earlier, a key goal of recovery is to have easy and appropriate access to all of the 4F’s.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1675 (Number of characters: 67):
There are also two more continuums that can be used to assess this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1676 (Number of characters: 90):
The degree to which we are
balanced along each of them reflects the degree of our healing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1677 (Number of characters: 164):
The Fight 
 Fawn Continuum of Healthy Relating to Others
Healthy relating occurs when two people move easily and reciprocally between assertiveness and
receptivity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1678 (Number of characters: 176):
Common and important examples of this are an easy back and forth [1] between
talking and listening, [2] between helping and being helped, and [3] between leading and
following.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1679 (Number of characters: 83):
Normal healthy narcissism and codependence happen at the midpoint of the continuum.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1680 (Number of characters: 120):
To
the degree that I polarize to the narcissistic/fight end of the continuum, I monologue and
dominate the conversation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1681 (Number of characters: 158):
To the degree that I polarize to the codependent/fawn end, I get stuck
in a listening defense, hiding from the vulnerability of showing what I think and feel.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1682 (Number of characters: 126):
Conversations, of course, will not always be exactly in the middle or it would be a Ping-
Pong-like exchange of monosyllables.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1683 (Number of characters: 39):
The real balance occurs more over time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1684 (Number of characters: 84):
For instance, in
an hour’s conversation, we each generally talk about half the time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1685 (Number of characters: 345):
The Flight 
 Freeze Continuum of Healthy Relating to Self
A healthy relationship with yourself is seen in your ability to move in a balanced way[1] between
doing and being, [2] between persistence and letting go, [3] between sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous system activation, and [4] between intense focus and relaxed,
daydreamy reverie.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1686 (Number of characters: 255):
RECOVERING FROM TRAUMA-BASED CODEPENDENCY
If you assessed yourself in the last chapter as a fawn subtype or as being on the right side of the
fight 
 fawn spectrum, you may find this chapter relevant even if the fawn response is not
your primary position.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1687 (Number of characters: 95):
Moreover the first section below contains important information about the
origins of all types.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1688 (Number of characters: 242):
I have dedicated a whole chapter to codependency because it is the 4F trauma response that
I know the most about. This knowledge comes from my own personal recovery journey, and
from specializing in treating codependency for over two decades.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1689 (Number of characters: 135):
I wrote the gist of this chapter one satori-blessed night when I noticed that I anxiously
apologized to a chair that I had bumped into.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1690 (Number of characters: 122):
I think I probably apologized to inanimate objects
many times before in my life, but this was the first time I noticed it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1691 (Number of characters: 172):
Realizing that I had just apologized to a chair suddenly made me feel enraged. I felt furious
that something had happened to me to give me a Pavlovian “I’m sorry” response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1692 (Number of characters: 177):
I had been pursuing family of origin exploration for quite some time, and the accumulated
evidence quickly convinced me that my parents deeply imprinted me with a fawn response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1693 (Number of characters: 132):
I was
brainwashed with a default program to ingratiatingly apologize when anything in the natural
order of things changed around me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1694 (Number of characters: 338):
Sudden anxiety responses to apparently innocuous circumstances like my example are often
emotional flashbacks to earlier traumatic events. Sometimes a current event can have only the
vaguest resemblance to a past traumatic situation, and this can be enough to trigger the psyche’s
hard-wiring for a fight, flight, freeze or fawn response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1695 (Number of characters: 196):
In this case I fawned to the chair, subliminally experiencing it as a dangerous parent and
codependently apologizing to it like a toddler anticipating punishment for touching something

forbidden.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1696 (Number of characters: 80):
As I free-associated on this I also realized that I was addicted to apologizing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1697 (Number of characters: 132):
I had
apologized for long traffic lights, for changes in the weather, and most especially for other
people’s mistakes and bad moods.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1698 (Number of characters: 226):
COMPARING FAWN ORIGINS WITH FIGHT, FLIGHT AND FREEZE
ORIGINS
I chose the name fawn for the fourth ‘F’ in the fight/flight/freeze/fawn typology, because
according to Webster, it means: “to act servilely; to cringe and flatter”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1699 (Number of characters: 81):
I believe it is this
response that is at the core of many codependents’ behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1700 (Number of characters: 119):
As a toddler, the codependent learns quickly that protesting abuse leads to even more
frightening parental retaliation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1701 (Number of characters: 155):
Thus she responds by relinquishing her fight response, deleting
“no” from her vocabulary and never developing the language skills of healthy assertiveness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1702 (Number of characters: 157):
Moreover, many abusive parents reserve their most harsh punishments for “talking back”,
and hence ruthlessly extinguish the fight response in their children.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1703 (Number of characters: 106):
Unfortunately, this typically
happens at such an early age that they later have little or no memory of it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1704 (Number of characters: 121):
The future codependent also learns early on that her natural flight response intensifies her
danger if she tries to flee.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1705 (Number of characters: 121):
“I’ll teach you to run away from me!” is a common response that
precedes the spanking typically awarded to such behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1706 (Number of characters: 162):
Later, when the child is older she may also learn that the ultimate flight response, running
away from home, is hopelessly impractical and even more danger-laden.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1707 (Number of characters: 170):
Traumatizing families,
however, seem to be on the rise, as there is an epidemic of children [as young as pre-teens]
becoming runaways and ending up in dire circumstances.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1708 (Number of characters: 108):
Many toddlers, at some point, transmute the flight urge into the running around in circles of
hyperactivity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1709 (Number of characters: 117):
This adaptation “works” on some level to help them escape from the
uncontainable feelings of the abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1710 (Number of characters: 71):
Many of these unfortunates later
symbolically run away from their pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1711 (Number of characters: 161):
They deteriorate into the obsessive-compulsive
adaptations of workaholism, busyholism, spend-aholism, and sex and love addiction that are
common in flight types.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1712 (Number of characters: 136):
The toddler who bypasses the adaptation of the flight defense may drift into developing the
freeze response and become the “lost child.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1713 (Number of characters: 79):
This child escapes his fear by slipping more and
more deeply into dissociation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1714 (Number of characters: 91):
He learns to let his parents’ verbal and emotional abuse “go in one
ear and out the other.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1715 (Number of characters: 142):
It is not uncommon for this type to devolve in adolescence into the
numbing substance addictions of pot, alcohol, opiates and other “downers”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1716 (Number of characters: 99):
The future codependent toddler, however, wisely gives up on the fight, flight and freeze
responses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1717 (Number of characters: 92):
Instead she learns to fawn her way into the occasional safety of being perceived as
helpful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1718 (Number of characters: 138):
It bears repeating that the fawn type is often one of the gifted children that Alice Miller
writes about in The Drama Of The Gifted Child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1719 (Number of characters: 125):
She is the precocious one who discovers that a
modicum of safety can be purchased by becoming variously useful to her parent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1720 (Number of characters: 81):
Servitude, ingratiation, and obsequiousness become important survival strategies.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1721 (Number of characters: 69):
She
cleverly forfeits all needs that might inconvenience her parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1722 (Number of characters: 64):
She stops having preferences and
opinions that might anger them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1723 (Number of characters: 108):
Boundaries of every kind are surrendered to mollify her parents,
who repudiate their duty of caring for her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1724 (Number of characters: 115):
As we saw in the last chapter, she is often parentified
and becomes as thoroughly helpful to the parent as she can.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1725 (Number of characters: 84):
I wonder how many therapists besides me were prepared for their careers in this way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1726 (Number of characters: 87):
All this loss of self begins before the child has many words, and certainly no insight.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1727 (Number of characters: 127):
For
the budding codependent, all hints of danger soon immediately trigger servile behaviors and
abdication of rights and needs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1728 (Number of characters: 247):
These response patterns are so deeply set in the psyche, that as adults, many codependents
automatically respond to threat like dogs, symbolically rolling over on their backs, wagging their
tails, hoping for a little mercy and an occasional scrap.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1729 (Number of characters: 115):
Webster’s second entry for fawn is: “to
show friendliness by licking hands, wagging its tail, etc.: said of a dog.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1730 (Number of characters: 89):
I find it tragic that some
codependents are as loyal as dogs to even the worst “masters”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1731 (Number of characters: 126):
Finally, I have noticed that extreme emotional abandonment, as described in chapter 5, also
creates this kind of codependency.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1732 (Number of characters: 167):
The severely neglected child experiences extreme lack of
connection as traumatic, and sometimes responds to this fearful condition by overdeveloping the
fawn response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1733 (Number of characters: 158):
Once a child realizes that being useful and not requiring anything for herself gets
her some positive attention from her parents, codependency begins to grow.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1734 (Number of characters: 58):
It becomes an
increasingly automatic habit over the years.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1735 (Number of characters: 118):
A DEFINITON OF TRAUMA-BASED CODEPENDENCY
More than a few of my clients were initially put off by the term codependent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1736 (Number of characters: 110):
They found it
confusing or irrelevant because the descriptions they read or heard were presented derogatorily.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1737 (Number of characters: 77):
Moreover, some felt that the descriptions did not pertain to their condition.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1738 (Number of characters: 147):
If that is true for you,
the section below on codependent subtypes explains how the fawn response can manifest in a
variety of different behaviors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1739 (Number of characters: 188):
I define trauma-induced codependency as a syndrome of self-abandonment and self-
abnegation. Codependency is a fear-based inability to express rights, needs and boundaries in
relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1740 (Number of characters: 142):
It is a disorder of assertiveness, characterized by a dormant fight response and a
susceptibility to being exploited, abused and/or neglected.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1741 (Number of characters: 106):
In conversations, codependents seek safety and acceptance in relationship through listening
and eliciting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1742 (Number of characters: 92):
They invite the other to talk rather than risk exposing their thoughts, views, and
feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1743 (Number of characters: 214):
They ask questions to keep the attention off themselves, because their parents taught
them that talking was dangerous and that their words were indictments that would inevitably
prove them guilty of being unworthy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1744 (Number of characters: 275):
The implicit code of the fawn type is that it is safer [1] to listen than to talk, [2] to agree
than to dissent, [3] to offer care than to ask for help, [4] to elicit the other than to express
yourself and [5] to leave choices to the other rather than to express preferences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1745 (Number of characters: 119):
Sadly, the closest
that the unrecovered fawn type comes to getting his needs met is vicariously through helping
others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1746 (Number of characters: 108):
Fawn types generally enhance their recovery by memorizing the list of Human Rights in
Toolbox 2, chapter 16.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1747 (Number of characters: 78):
I have this sardonic fantasy about two codependents going on their first date.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1748 (Number of characters: 98):
Somehow
they have agreed that they want to go to a movie, but how will they ever choose which one?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1749 (Number of characters: 66):
“What do you want to see?” “Oh, I’m easy what do you want to see?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1750 (Number of characters: 52):
“It really doesn’t matter to
me, I like everything.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1751 (Number of characters: 30):
‘Me too why don’t you choose?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1752 (Number of characters: 156):
“Oh I think it would be much better if
you pick.” “Oh I couldn’t, I never pick the right one.” “Me too, but I’m sure my pick would
definitely be the worst.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1753 (Number of characters: 146):
And so it goes, ad infinitum, until it is too late to see any show, and

relieved at not having to put themselves out there, they call it a night.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1754 (Number of characters: 485):
CODEPENDENT SUBTYPES
I think a certain amount of the confusion about codependency can be clarified through
understanding the significant differences found in the three codependent subtypes that follow:
fawn-freeze, fawn-flight and fawn-fight. Fawn-Freeze: The Scapegoat
The fawn-freeze is typically the most codependently entrenched subtype. Not all scapegoats are
fawn-freeze, but since fawn and freeze types are both prone to extreme self-denial, many end up
in a scapegoat position.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1755 (Number of characters: 68):
This is also because these are the two most passive of the four F’s.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1756 (Number of characters: 113):
They have both typically
suffered the most punishment or rejection for asserting themselves in the toddler stage.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1757 (Number of characters: 135):
When the fawn-freeze is not able to escape the scapegoat role in childhood, she is then set
up to be similarly victimized in adulthood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1758 (Number of characters: 96):
In worst case scenarios fawn-freezes are easily recognized by fight types who take them
captive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1759 (Number of characters: 81):
They may then turn them into doormats and subject them to domestic violence [DV].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1760 (Number of characters: 76):
Sometimes, the fawn-freeze does not even recognize that she is being abused.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1761 (Number of characters: 30):
Other times she
blames herself

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1762 (Number of characters: 29):
[as she had to in childhood].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1763 (Number of characters: 180):
Moreover, as we know from studying the DV cycle, many narcissistic abusers know when
and how to shower romantic tidbits on their victims just when they are at the point of leaving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1764 (Number of characters: 79):
These narcissists are often the charming bullies described in the last chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1765 (Number of characters: 184):
Their infrequent
tidbits have more warmth in them than anything the codependent received at home, so she
quickly becomes re-hooked, and just as quickly the cycle of abuse begins again.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1766 (Number of characters: 189):
It is important to note that many charming bullies also offer copious tidbits briefly in the
courtship stage, but these peter out to near starvation rations once the entrapment is complete.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1767 (Number of characters: 95):
Many fawn-freeze types only make token efforts at recovery, if they do not avoid it
altogether.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1768 (Number of characters: 156):
Often fawn-freezes were forced to so thoroughly abandon their protective instincts
that they become trapped in what psychologists call learned helplessness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1769 (Number of characters: 107):
Finally, there is growing evidence that a significant number of men also silently suffer
domestic violence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1770 (Number of characters: 313):
A male client once told me that no matter how much his wife assaulted him,
he couldn’t stop himself from saying “I’m sorry” to her. This only made her madder, but not as
mad as when he flashbacked into saying: “I’m sorry for saying ‘I’m sorry’ “, even though his
wife would slap him in the face every time he did.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1771 (Number of characters: 133):
Not surprisingly, further investigation revealed a borderline mother who still slaps him in
the face when she is displeased with him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1772 (Number of characters: 75):
As a child he was required to keep his hands down
whenever she slapped him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1773 (Number of characters: 61):
He then had to apologize for making her “have to” punish him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1774 (Number of characters: 164):
Unfortunately, he left therapy after only a few sessions because his wife looked in his
checkbook, and then hit him repeatedly for “wasting his time and her money.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1775 (Number of characters: 105):
I have worked a great deal with these fawn-freeze types in my years of doing telephone
crisis counseling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1776 (Number of characters: 98):
Hope for them lies in understanding how their childhood abuse set them up for
their current abuse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1777 (Number of characters: 111):
This is often difficult, because scapegoated fawn-freezes were often punished

extra intensely for complaining.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1778 (Number of characters: 85):
Numerous times I have heard DV victims say: “But, I don’t want to act like a victim!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1779 (Number of characters: 206):
Usually, I then try to help them see how much they truly were victims in childhood. However, if
I cannot get them to see this they usually are not able to rescue themselves from their current
victimization.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1780 (Number of characters: 224):
Fawn-Flight: Super Nurse
The fawn-flight type is most typically seen in the busyholic parent, nurse or administrative
assistant who works from dawn until bedtime providing for the needs of the household, hospital
or company.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1781 (Number of characters: 89):
He compulsively takes care of everyone else’s needs with hardly a gesture toward
his own.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1782 (Number of characters: 159):
The fawn-flight is sometimes a misguided Mother Teresa type, who escapes the pain of her
self-abandonment by seeing herself as the perfect, selfless caregiver.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1783 (Number of characters: 117):
She further distances
herself from her own pain by obsessive-compulsively rushing from one person in need to
another.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1784 (Number of characters: 60):
Some fawn-flight clients also become OCD-like clean-aholics.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1785 (Number of characters: 162):
One of my interns told me
that her fawn-flight client had a dozen color-coded tooth brushes for various micro-cleaning
tasks in her family’s bathroom and kitchen.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1786 (Number of characters: 56):
Some fawn-flights project their perfectionism on others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1787 (Number of characters: 90):
They can appoint themselves as
honorary advisers, and overburden others with their advice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1788 (Number of characters: 82):
However, it behooves fawn-flights to
learn that caring is not always about fixing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1789 (Number of characters: 83):
This is especially true when the person we are trying
to help is in emotional pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1790 (Number of characters: 97):
Many times all that person needs is empathy, acceptance and an
opportunity to verbally ventilate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1791 (Number of characters: 52):
Moreover some mood states also need time to resolve.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1792 (Number of characters: 69):
Loving
people when they are feeling bad is a powerful kind of caring.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1793 (Number of characters: 58):
The above also relates to allowing others to be imperfect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1794 (Number of characters: 72):
We all have minor limitations and
foibles that may not be transformable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1795 (Number of characters: 75):
Loved ones need to be spared from being pressured to fix
what is unfixable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1796 (Number of characters: 80):
My way of approaching this is to always frame my advice as take-it or leave-
it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1797 (Number of characters: 72):
To prove this is so, I refrain from then going on about it repetitively.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1798 (Number of characters: 97):
Additionally, I typically
check in first to see if the other person actually wants some feedback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1799 (Number of characters: 137):
Fawn-Fight: Smother Mother
The recommendations in the last two paragraphs also apply to many of those survivors who are
fawn-fight types.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1800 (Number of characters: 62):
Some can be quite aggressive in their attempts to help others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1801 (Number of characters: 122):
Typically they
equate helping with changing, and can alienate others by persistently pressuring them to take
their advice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1802 (Number of characters: 50):
The fawn-fight type is the smother-love caretaker.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1803 (Number of characters: 117):
Her care-taking approach of being over-
focused on the other is sometimes a repetition of her childhood servant role.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1804 (Number of characters: 113):
Moreover, her
helpfulness is usually less self-serving than the fight-fawn that we discussed in the last chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1805 (Number of characters: 129):
Nonetheless, the zealousness of her caretaking sometimes makes the recipient believe it when
she says “I just love you to death.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1806 (Number of characters: 92):
In flashback, the fawn-fight can deteriorate into manipulative or even coercive care-taking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1807 (Number of characters: 79):
He can smother love the other into conforming to his view of who she should be.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1808 (Number of characters: 157):
Fawn-fight types may periodically reach a critical mass of frustration that erupts when the
“patient” refuses his advice or balks at his unwanted caretaking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1809 (Number of characters: 125):
Sometimes the fawn-fight feels
an entitlement to punish the other “for their own good”, especially in a primary relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1810 (Number of characters: 82):
The fawn-fight is sometimes misdiagnosed as borderline personality disorder [BPD].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1811 (Number of characters: 76):
This is
because the fawn-fight can be emotionally intense during flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1812 (Number of characters: 167):
When triggered into a
panicky sense of abandonment, he feels desperate for love and can vacillate dramatically
between clawing for it or flatteringly groveling for it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1813 (Number of characters: 110):
He does not however have the core
narcissism of the true borderline that we looked at in the previous chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1814 (Number of characters: 88):
Another distinction between these two types is that fawn-fight type seeks real intimacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1815 (Number of characters: 210):
She
is the most relational hybrid and most susceptible to love addiction. She stands in
contradistinction to the fight-fawn who is more addicted to physical release, and hence more
susceptible to sex addiction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1816 (Number of characters: 154):
MORE ON RECOVERING FROM A POLARIZED FAWN RESPONSE
Psychoeducation about their parents’ role in creating their fawn response has helped many of my
clients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1817 (Number of characters: 169):
Many instantly grasped that their codependence comes from having been continuously
attacked and shamed as selfish for even the most basic level of healthy self-interest.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1818 (Number of characters: 165):
One fortyish client estimated that she had scorned herself as “selfish” countless times, until
one night she had the epiphany that she was by far not selfish enough.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1819 (Number of characters: 152):
This occurred while she
was reading the comments of respondents to a website for adult children of narcissistic mothers [
www.narcissisticmothers.org ].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1820 (Number of characters: 97):
Suddenly she realized that her mother was the one with a
monopoly on self-interest in her family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1821 (Number of characters: 178):
My client then realized that every time she thought of
doing something for herself, she not only felt very anxious, but also ashamed that she was acting
as ghastly as her mother.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1822 (Number of characters: 138):
Fawns need to understand that fear of being attacked for lapses in ingratiation causes them
to forfeit their boundaries, rights and needs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1823 (Number of characters: 78):
Understanding this dynamic is a necessary but not
sufficient step in recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1824 (Number of characters: 186):
There are many codependents who realize their penchant for
forfeiting themselves, but who instantly forget everything they know when self-assertion is
appropriate in their relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1825 (Number of characters: 113):
In early recovery, I became increasingly aware in new dating situations of how much I was
over-eliciting my date.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1826 (Number of characters: 115):
Eventually, I was struck by how little I had to say for myself, but I found
it very difficult to break the pattern.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1827 (Number of characters: 99):
Over time, I realized that my intention to be more forthcoming was frightening me into a
flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1828 (Number of characters: 67):
This made me dissociate and forget everything I had planned to say.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1829 (Number of characters: 108):
All I could think
to do, when an amygdala hijacking took my left-brain off line, was to get my date talking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1830 (Number of characters: 82):
I then
regressed to the tried and true safety position of listening and eliciting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1831 (Number of characters: 122):
It wasn’t until my therapist recommended that I write down some key words on my palm
that I began to master the situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1832 (Number of characters: 144):
Looking at the words brought my left-brain back online, and
I gradually got better at holding up my end of the getting-to-know-you conversation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1833 (Number of characters: 90):
Much later, I had the realization: “No wonder I wind up with one narcissist after another.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1834 (Number of characters: 65):
Narcissists love me because I am so enabling of their monologing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1835 (Number of characters: 143):
I probably met lots of nice
balanced people who did not want another date with me because it seemed like I was hiding and
hard to get to know.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1836 (Number of characters: 72):
Around this time I also had a fawn type friend who had the same problem.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1837 (Number of characters: 167):
She liked to joke
that her listening and eliciting defenses where so perfected that she could turn anyone, even a
blank-screen therapist, into a monologing narcissist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1838 (Number of characters: 141):
To break free of their codependence, survivors must learn to stay present to the fear that
triggers the self-abdication of the fawn response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1839 (Number of characters: 118):
In the face of their fear, they must try on and
practice an expanding repertoire of more functional responses to fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1840 (Number of characters: 180):
[See the flashback
management steps in the next chapter]
Facing The Fear Of Self-Disclosure
Real motivation for surmounting this challenge usually comes from family of origin work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1841 (Number of characters: 144):
We
need to intuit and puzzle together a detailed picture of the trauma that first frightened us out of
our instincts of healthy self-expression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1842 (Number of characters: 162):
When we emotionally remember how overpowered we were as children, we can begin to
realize that it was because we were too small and powerless to assert ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1843 (Number of characters: 70):
But now in our
adult bodies, we are in a much more powerful situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1844 (Number of characters: 156):
And even though we might still momentarily feel small and helpless when we are triggered,
we can learn to remind ourselves that we are now in an adult body.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1845 (Number of characters: 140):
We have an adult status that
now offers us many more resources to champion ourselves and to effectively protest unfairness
in relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1846 (Number of characters: 121):
Grieving Through Codependence
I usually find that deconstructing codependence involves a considerable amount of grieving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1847 (Number of characters: 126):
Typically this entails many tears about the loss and pain of being so long without healthy self-
interest and self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1848 (Number of characters: 92):
Grieving also unlocks healthy anger about a life lived with such a
diminished sense of self.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1849 (Number of characters: 62):
This anger can then be used to build a healthy fight response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1850 (Number of characters: 184):
Once again, the fight response
is the basis of the instinct of self-protection, of balanced assertiveness, and of the courage that is
needed to make relationships equal and reciprocal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1851 (Number of characters: 153):
Later Stage Recovery
To facilitate the reclaiming of assertiveness, I encourage the survivor to imagine herself
confronting a current or past unfairness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1852 (Number of characters: 115):
This type of role-playing is often delicate work, as it can
invoke a therapeutic flashback that brings up old fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1853 (Number of characters: 330):
As the survivor learns to stay present in assertiveness role-plays, she becomes more aware
of how fear triggers her into fawning. She can then practice staying present to her fear and acting
assertively anyway. With enough practice she then heals the developmental arrest of not having learned “to feel
the fear and do it anyway.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1854 (Number of characters: 115):
This in turn sets the stage for deconstructing self-harmful reactions to
fear like giving or compromising too much.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1855 (Number of characters: 67):
Moreover, it makes the survivor more adept at
flashback management.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1856 (Number of characters: 83):
As later stage recovery progresses, the survivor increasingly “knows her own mind”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1857 (Number of characters: 101):
She

slowly dissolves the habit of reflexively agreeing with other people’s preferences and opinions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1858 (Number of characters: 74):
She more easily expresses her own point of view and makes her own choices.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1859 (Number of characters: 56):
And most
importantly, she learns to stay inside herself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1860 (Number of characters: 122):
Many fawns survived by constantly focusing their awareness on their parents to figure out
what was needed to appease them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1861 (Number of characters: 89):
Some became almost psychic in their ability to read their
parents moods and expectations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1862 (Number of characters: 84):
This then helped them to figure out the best response to
neutralize parental danger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1863 (Number of characters: 54):
For some, it even occasionally won them some approval.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1864 (Number of characters: 166):
Survivors now need to deconstruct this habit by working to stay more inside their own
experience without constantly projecting their attention outward to read others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1865 (Number of characters: 107):
Fawn-types who
are still habituated to people-pleasing, must work on reducing their ingratiating behaviors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1866 (Number of characters: 143):
I have
noticed over the years that the degree to which a survivor strains to please me reflects the degree
to which his parents were dangerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1867 (Number of characters: 104):
Recovering requires us to become increasingly mindful of our automatic matching and
mirroring behaviors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1868 (Number of characters: 90):
This helps us decrease the habit of reflexively agreeing with everything that
anyone says.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1869 (Number of characters: 69):
It is a great accomplishment to significantly reduce verbal matching.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1870 (Number of characters: 82):
It is an even more
powerful achievement to reduce inauthentic emotional mirroring.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1871 (Number of characters: 199):
Dysfunctional emotional matching is seen in behaviors such as acting amused at destructive
sarcasm, acting loving when someone is punishing, and acting forgiving when someone is
repetitively hurtful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1872 (Number of characters: 41):
I call this emotional individuation work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1873 (Number of characters: 258):
As such, recovery involves setting the kind of
boundaries that help us to stay true to our own actual emotional experience. In advanced recovery, this occurs when we reduce the habit of automatically shifting our
mood to match someone else’s emotional state.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1874 (Number of characters: 74):
By this, I do not mean suppressing empathic
attunement when it is genuine.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1875 (Number of characters: 75):
Crying and laughing along with an intimate is a truly wonderful
experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1876 (Number of characters: 121):
Rather, what I am recommending here is resisting the pressure to pretend you are always
feeling the same as someone else.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1877 (Number of characters: 53):
You do not have to laugh when something is not funny.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1878 (Number of characters: 141):
When
a friend is feeling bad, you do not have to act like you feel bad. When you are feeling bad, you
do not have to act like you feel happy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1879 (Number of characters: 69):
Thankfully, I learned a great deal about this from being a therapist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1880 (Number of characters: 230):
When my client is
depressed, it does not help him if I adjust my mood and act depressed. Yet I am always genuinely empathic toward my client’s depression, because I can put
myself in his shoes via my own experiences of depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1881 (Number of characters: 95):
I can be there caringly for him
without abandoning my own feeling of contentment in the moment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1882 (Number of characters: 176):
Similarly I can be feeling depressed while you are enthused about something and genuinely
appreciate your happiness without shamefully abandoning my temporarily depressed self.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1883 (Number of characters: 32):
Here is another example of this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1884 (Number of characters: 86):
You are in a great mood and tell me that you loved this old
musical that you just saw.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1885 (Number of characters: 53):
I, however, am feeling down and dislike old musicals.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1886 (Number of characters: 85):
If I were a fight
type, the table would be set for a great deal of mutual alienation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1887 (Number of characters: 191):
If I were an unrecovered fawn type, however, I might strangle my bad mood and my
musical taste, and anxiously squeeze out a high-pitched, forced frivolity about how wonderful
Fred Astaire is.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1888 (Number of characters: 55):
Instead, I can reach for a deeper more authentic truth.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1889 (Number of characters: 62):
I can let you know that I
am pleased you had such a nice time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1890 (Number of characters: 69):
After all, I really believe in different strokes for different
folks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1891 (Number of characters: 69):
As I write this, I flash on Bruno, a dear old hospice client of mine.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1892 (Number of characters: 83):
During a visit, with him,
he told me: “I can’t stand talking to that new volunteer.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1893 (Number of characters: 42):
She acts so morose whenever she visits
me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1894 (Number of characters: 45):
I mean, who the hell’s dying here… me or her?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1895 (Number of characters: 136):
I tell ya I don’t know who is worse – her or
that other smiley volunteer, the one who always acts like she just walked into Disneyland.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1896 (Number of characters: 122):
“Disapproval Is Okay With Me”
Early in recovery, an esteemed mentor gave me the affirmation “Disapproval is okay with me.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1897 (Number of characters: 98):
Codependently, I enthusiastically welcomed his advice that I should practice it until it was true.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1898 (Number of characters: 38):
Privately I thought “Surely you jest!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1899 (Number of characters: 121):
I had survived the previous thirty years with a Will
Rogers-like mission to prove that “I never met a man I didn’t like.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1900 (Number of characters: 209):
I did not yet know that I had unconsciously gravitated to this all-or-none nonsense because I
was somewhat desperately trying to seduce everyone I met into liking me in the hope that I could
finally feel safe.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1901 (Number of characters: 103):
As I thought further about this affirmation, I judged it as patently absurd and eminently
unachievable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1902 (Number of characters: 79):
Yet within a week something ignited in me that really wanted it to become true.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1903 (Number of characters: 130):
Since it was still a long time before I knew anything about code-pendence, it took almost
two decades to make any progress at all.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1904 (Number of characters: 106):
The importance of learning to handle and accept
disapproval faded in and out of my awareness myriad times.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1905 (Number of characters: 105):
But now as I write thirty years later, I feel it is one of the most important things I have ever
learned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1906 (Number of characters: 152):
I rest most of the time in receiving so much approval from my friends and intimates that
I can usually let in their constructive feedback fairly easily.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1907 (Number of characters: 105):
As a corollary to this, I rarely care
what people think about me who I do not know or who do not know me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1908 (Number of characters: 53):
And, of course, this is not a perfect accomplishment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1909 (Number of characters: 62):
Disapproval can still on occasion
trigger me into a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1910 (Number of characters: 171):
But it delights me to report that I now experience most disapproval
with considerable equanimity. I even occasionally experience some people’s disapproval as a
good thing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1911 (Number of characters: 97):
Sometimes it is a validation that I am doing the right thing and evolving in the right
direction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1912 (Number of characters: 150):
Nowhere is this truer than with the disapproval of the narcissistic parents or partners of
clients whom I am working to rescue from their enslavement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1913 (Number of characters: 147):
Their disapproval of me is actually
an affirmation that I have indeed been involved in right action. Most of the time, disapproval is okay with me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1914 (Number of characters: 342):
MANAGING EMOTIONAL FLASHBACKS
Emotional flashbacks are intensely disturbing regressions [“amygdala hijackings”] to the
overwhelming feeling-states of your childhood abandonment. When you are stuck in a flashback,
fear, shame and/or depression can dominate your experience. These are some common experiences of being in an emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1915 (Number of characters: 38):
You feel little,
fragile and helpless.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1916 (Number of characters: 26):
Everything feels too hard.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1917 (Number of characters: 18):
Life is too scary.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1918 (Number of characters: 43):
Being seen feels excruciatingly
vulnerable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1919 (Number of characters: 30):
Your battery seems to be dead.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1920 (Number of characters: 80):
In the worst flashbacks an apocalypse feels like it will
imminently be upon you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1921 (Number of characters: 97):
When you are trapped in a flashback, you are reliving the worst emotional times of you
childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1922 (Number of characters: 124):
Everything feels overwhelming and confusing, especially because there are rarely any
visual components to a Cptsd flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1923 (Number of characters: 159):
This is because, as Goleman’s work shows, amygdala
hijackings are intense reactions in the emotional memory part of the brain that override the
rational brain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1924 (Number of characters: 159):
These reactions occur in the brains of people who have been triggered into a 4F
reaction so often, that minor events can now trigger them into a panicky state.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1925 (Number of characters: 134):
This is a list of 13 practical steps for helping yourself to manage an emotional flashback:
13 Steps for Managing Emotional Flashbacks

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1926 (Number of characters: 49):
[Focus on Bold Print when flashback is active]
1.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1927 (Number of characters: 43):
Say to yourself: “I am having a flashback”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1928 (Number of characters: 138):
Flashbacks take you into a timeless part
of the psyche that feels as helpless, hopeless and surrounded by danger as you were in
childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1929 (Number of characters: 92):
The feelings and sensations you are experiencing are past memories that
cannot hurt you now.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1930 (Number of characters: 58):
2. Remind yourself: “I feel afraid but I am not in danger!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1931 (Number of characters: 120):
I am safe now, here in the
present.” Remember you are now in the safety of the present, far from the danger of
the past.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1932 (Number of characters: 42):
3. Own your right/need to have boundaries.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1980 (Number of characters: 126):
Triggers And Emotional Flashbacks
A trigger is an external or internal stimulus that activates us into an emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1981 (Number of characters: 87):
This
often occurs on a subliminal level outside the boundaries of normal consciousness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1982 (Number of characters: 434):
Recognizing
what triggers us can therefore be difficult. Nonetheless, becoming increasingly mindful of our
triggers is crucial because it sometimes allows us to avoid flashback-inducing people, situations
and behaviors. External triggers are people, places, things, events, facial expressions, styles of
communication, etc., that remind us of our original trauma in a way that flashes us back into the
painful feelings of those times.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1983 (Number of characters: 264):
Here are some examples of powerful and common triggers:
revisiting your parents; seeing someone who resembles a childhood abuser; experiencing the
anniversary of an especially traumatic event; hearing someone use a parent’s shaming tone of
voice or turn of phrase.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1984 (Number of characters: 42):
Many triggers however are not so explicit.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1985 (Number of characters: 114):
Sometimes all unknown adults can trigger us
into fear even when there is no resemblance to our original abuser[s].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1986 (Number of characters: 148):
I still occasionally feel
triggered when I come across a group of teenagers, because I grew up in a neighborhood where
there were many violent ones.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1987 (Number of characters: 104):
For this reason, my son who is quite empathic joked that he will
not become a teenager when he grows up.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1988 (Number of characters: 95):
Sometimes someone looking at us, or even noticing us, can trigger us into fear and toxic
shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1989 (Number of characters: 84):
One of my clients once came in intensely triggered because a cat was staring at him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1990 (Number of characters: 114):
Other common triggers include making a mistake, asking for help, or having to speak in front of
a group of people.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1991 (Number of characters: 89):
Moreover, simply feeling tired, sick, lonely or hungry can sometimes trigger a
flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1992 (Number of characters: 48):
Any type of physical pain can also be a trigger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1993 (Number of characters: 64):
For many survivors, authority figures are the ultimate triggers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1994 (Number of characters: 159):
I have known several
survivors, who have never gotten so much as a parking ticket, who cringe in anxiety whenever
they come across a policeman or a police car.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1995 (Number of characters: 77):
It took me decades to overcome my intense performance anxiety about teaching.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1996 (Number of characters: 67):
Nothing
could trigger me more than an upcoming teaching engagement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1997 (Number of characters: 109):
Fortunately I was unwilling to
give up this activity, because I enjoyed it most of the time once I got going.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1998 (Number of characters: 178):
I did not make any
real progress, beyond learning to “white-knuckle it,” until I recognized my performance anxiety

as a flashback to the danger of talking at family dinner time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1999 (Number of characters: 134):
This recognition allowed me to see
that I was unconsciously terrified that my parents were going to show up and scoff at me in
public.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2000 (Number of characters: 239):
At first, I [my critic] labeled this a preposterous idea, but when I started to imagine and
practice aggressively defending myself against them on the drive to my teaching engagement, I
soon experienced an enormous reduction in my anxiety.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2001 (Number of characters: 185):
This experience lead to me formulating
Step 6 in the flashback management steps above, as well as my ideas about angering against the
critic, which will be explored in the next chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2002 (Number of characters: 203):
The Look: A Common Trigger Of Emotional Flashbacks
Early on in working with this model, I was surprised that certain clients with relatively moderate
childhood abuse were plagued by emotional flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2003 (Number of characters: 71):
Most of them in fact were quite sure that
they had never even been hit.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2004 (Number of characters: 94):
Many of them however would talk about how they hated it when
their parents gave them the look.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2005 (Number of characters: 193):
The look, in most cases, is the facial expression that typically accompanies contempt. Contempt is a powerful punishing visage backed up by an emotional force-field of intimidation
and disgust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2006 (Number of characters: 75):
A raised voice can be added intermittently to the look to amp up its power.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2007 (Number of characters: 158):
When a parent gives the look to a child, she is “telling” him that he is not only in serious
jeopardy, but that he is also “a sorry excuse for a human being”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2008 (Number of characters: 301):
Over time, the look can make
the recipient feel terrified and repugnant, as it drives him into an emotional flashback of fear and
shame. When the look is used to control an older child, it commonly flashes her back to an earlier,
pre-memory time when the look was empowered by traumatizing punishment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2009 (Number of characters: 290):
The look rarely
terrifies a child into obedience unless it has previously been paired with hitting or other dire
consequences. Years of working at Parental Stress Services convinced me that most young
children ignore the look unless it was previously accompanied by traumatizing punishment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2010 (Number of characters: 81):
Typically, the look is empowered via a psychological process called conditioning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2011 (Number of characters: 51):
Here is a
classic example of aversive conditioning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2012 (Number of characters: 100):
Technicians deliver an electric shock to an animal in a
cage at the same time that they ring a bell.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2013 (Number of characters: 222):
The animal of course has a fearful and distressed
response to the shock. It does not, however, take many repetitions of pairing the sound with the
shock before the sound alone elicits the same upset response in the animal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2014 (Number of characters: 80):
This is analogous, I believe, to how a child learns to be terrified of the look.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2015 (Number of characters: 169):
With enough
pairings of the look with physical punishment or extreme abandonment, the parent can
eventually delete the smack and get the same results with just the look.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2016 (Number of characters: 141):
With enough repetitions
in early childhood, this pairing can last a lifetime, so that the parent can control the child forever
with the look.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2017 (Number of characters: 137):
In my hospice work, I have seen several dying, ninety-pound mothers still able to
put the fear of god into their huge sons with the look.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2018 (Number of characters: 121):
The look then is a powerful trigger for making adult survivors flashback to the fear and
humiliation of their childhoods.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2019 (Number of characters: 196):
Once again, many of my clients do not remember this because
the punishment only had to accompany the look for a few months while they were toddlers
before it became permanently wired as a trigger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2020 (Number of characters: 88):
Moreover, it is the rare person who has any
memory before he is three or four years old.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2021 (Number of characters: 71):
Unfortunately the look can continue to work even after the parent dies.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2022 (Number of characters: 41):
There are at least

two reasons for this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2023 (Number of characters: 152):
First, we internalize our parents in a way that they can subliminally appear in our
imaginations and give us the look whenever we are less than perfect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2024 (Number of characters: 60):
This includes
“imperfections” in thought, feeling or action.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2025 (Number of characters: 131):
Sadly, I often see this subliminal look mimicked on the faces of my flashbacked clients as
they scowl contemptuously at themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2026 (Number of characters: 117):
And second, when anyone else looks at us disapprovingly, we can generalize that they are
as dangerous as our parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2027 (Number of characters: 85):
This is what happened to me in the emotional flashback that I
described in chapter 1.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2028 (Number of characters: 178):
The worst thing about having been traumatized with the look in childhood is that we can
erroneously transfer and project our memory of it onto other people when we are triggered.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2029 (Number of characters: 139):
We
are especially prone to doing this with authority figures or people that resemble our parents, even
when they are not sporting the look.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2030 (Number of characters: 148):
Internal vs. External Triggers
As we move out of early recovery, we begin to observe that internal triggers are even more
common than external ones.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2031 (Number of characters: 63):
Such triggers are commonly the nasty spawn of the inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2032 (Number of characters: 93):
Typically they are thoughts and visualizations about endangerment or the need for perfection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2033 (Number of characters: 76):
The survivor may, seemingly without reason, visualize someone being abusive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2034 (Number of characters: 258):
Moreover he can
also, seemingly out of the blue, worry himself into a flashback by simply thinking he is not
perfectly executing a task that he is undertaking. He can also frighten himself by enumerating the
many ways that he might mess up any upcoming task.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2035 (Number of characters: 129):
When internal triggering is at its worst, small potato miscues and peccadilloes trigger us
into a full blown emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2036 (Number of characters: 117):
We then devolve into a polarized process of negative-
noticing – an incessant preoccupation with defects and hazards.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2037 (Number of characters: 64):
We perseverate about everything
that has gone or could go wrong.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2038 (Number of characters: 166):
As recovery progresses, many survivors are shocked to discover that the majority of their
flashbacks are triggered internally by these types of inner critic programs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2039 (Number of characters: 132):
We will explore below
and in the next two chapters the ways we can rescue ourselves from the critic’s internal
triggering processes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2040 (Number of characters: 225):
Progressive Trigger-Recognition
With ongoing recovery, we become more knowledgeable about our triggers, and avoid them
when practical. Identifying our triggers also helps us to get into flashback management mode
more quickly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2041 (Number of characters: 72):
Recognition further aids us to handle unavoidable triggering situations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2042 (Number of characters: 161):
Forethought allows
us to prophylactically practice flashback management before we get activated, as I did in the
performance anxiety situation mentioned earlier.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2043 (Number of characters: 96):
Recognizing the moment of triggering is even more important than recognizing the trigger
itself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2044 (Number of characters: 354):
This is because flashbacks sometimes start out subtly and then progressively become more
intense. Early recognition therefore helps us to invoke the steps earlier, and decrease the intensity
and duration of the flashback. Finally, resolving a flashback requires rebalancing significant biochemical changes in the
brain and body that take time to subside.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2045 (Number of characters: 152):
For example, over-adrenalization sometimes
dramatically morphs into the hangover of adrenalin exhaustion, before the adrenal function can
be rebalanced.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2046 (Number of characters: 125):
Decreasing the intensity of a flashback with quick remedial action decreases the
time it takes for our physiology to recover.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2047 (Number of characters: 460):
Signs Of Being In A Flashback
We can often find ourselves in a flashback without ever having seen the “flash.” There are a
variety of clues that we can learn to identify as signs that we are caught in a flashback. This is
essential to recovery, as naming our experience “flashback” [step#1 in flashback management]
often immediately brings some relief. Even more importantly, it points us in the direction of
working the other 12 steps of flashback management.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2048 (Number of characters: 84):
One common sign of being flashed-back is that we feel small, helpless, and hopeless.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2049 (Number of characters: 115):
In
intense flashbacks this magnifies into feeling so ashamed that we are loath to go out or show our
face anywhere.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2050 (Number of characters: 82):
Feeling fragile, on edge, delicate and easily crushable is another aspect of this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2051 (Number of characters: 101):
The survivor may also notice an evaporation of whatever self-esteem he has earned since he left
home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2052 (Number of characters: 103):
This is a flashback to the childhood years where implicit family rules forbade any self-
esteem at all.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2053 (Number of characters: 107):
Another common clue that we are flashing back is an increase in the virulence of the inner
or outer critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2054 (Number of characters: 136):
This typically looks like increased drasticizing and catastrophizing, as well as
intensified self-criticism or judgmentalness of others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2055 (Number of characters: 161):
A very common example of this is lapsing
into extremely polarized, all-or-none thinking such as only being able to see what is wrong with
yourself and/or others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2056 (Number of characters: 174):
In my own mid-level recovery, I learned that when I was feeling especially judgmental of
others, it usually meant that I had flashed back to being around my critical parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2057 (Number of characters: 74):
The trigger
was usually that some vulnerability of mine was in ascendancy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2058 (Number of characters: 159):
In response, I then over-noticed
others’ faults so that I could justify avoiding them and the embarrassment of being seen in a state
of not being shiny enough.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2059 (Number of characters: 140):
Another clue that we are in a flashback occurs when we notice that our emotional reactions
are out of proportion to what has triggered them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2060 (Number of characters: 38):
Here are two common instances of this:

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2061 (Number of characters: 99):
[1] a
minor upset feels like an emergency; [2] a minor unfairness feels like a travesty of justice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2062 (Number of characters: 132):
In the first instance, you drop a book that you are carrying and launch into an angry, self-
berating tirade that lingers for hours.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2063 (Number of characters: 167):
In the second instance, another driver’s relatively harmless,
un-signaled lane change triggers you into rageful indignation that reverberates in your psyche for
hours.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2064 (Number of characters: 172):
When we are not mindful at such times, we can erupt against ourselves in self-disgust and
self-hatred, or we can unfairly explode out against the relatively innocent other.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2065 (Number of characters: 287):
On the other hand, we can choose healthy flashback management once we recognize these
examples as flashbacks to the real emergencies and injustices of our childhood. Furthermore, we
can harvest recovery out of these unpleasant flashbacks by seeing them as proof that we were
traumatized.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2066 (Number of characters: 130):
When we do the latter, we can morph our anger into healthy indignation about the
outrageously unfair conditions of our upbringing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2067 (Number of characters: 122):
More On Self-Medication
Another clue about being in a flashback is an increased use of primitive self-soothing techniques.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2068 (Number of characters: 130):
Many survivors learn early in life to manage their painful feelings with food, distracting
activities or mood-altering substances.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2069 (Number of characters: 238):
Over time self-medication can become habitual and
devolve into substance or process addictions. With self-medication, I believe there is a continuum of severity that stretches from
occasional use on one end to true addiction on the other.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2070 (Number of characters: 58):
For many survivors, self-medication is a
matter of degree.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2071 (Number of characters: 253):
An especially strong urge to use more substance or process than normal is a
powerful clue that you are in a flashback. With practice, mindfully noticing a sudden upsurge in
craving can be interpreted as the need to invoke the flashback management steps.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2072 (Number of characters: 112):
Moreover, I
see many survivors gradually decrease their self-medicating habits by effectively using these
steps.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2073 (Number of characters: 30):
Flashbacks In Therapy Sessions

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2074 (Number of characters: 78):
This section is for survivors who are in therapy or contemplating starting it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2075 (Number of characters: 277):
Over the years, I
have noticed that as survivors feel safe enough with me, opportunities arise more frequently for
working with flashbacks during sessions. Sometimes it even seems that some part of them
“schedules” their flashbacks to occur just prior to or during our session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2076 (Number of characters: 79):
It is as if they are
looking for “on the job training” in flashback management.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2077 (Number of characters: 87):
Some therapists describe this as
regression in the service of building the healthy ego.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2078 (Number of characters: 115):
I recently experienced this with a client who rushed into my office five minutes late, visibly
flushed and anxious.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2079 (Number of characters: 56):
She opened the session by exclaiming: “I’m such a loser.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2080 (Number of characters: 26):
I can’t do
anything right.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2081 (Number of characters: 37):
You must be sick of working with me.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2082 (Number of characters: 120):
This was someone who had, on previous
occasions, been moved by my validation of her ongoing accomplishments in our work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2083 (Number of characters: 172):
Based on what she had uncovered about her mother’s punitive perfectionism in previous
sessions, I was certain that being late had triggered her into an emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2084 (Number of characters: 116):
In this
moment, she was experiencing right-brain emotional dominance and a decrease in left-brain
rational thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2085 (Number of characters: 115):
As so often happens in a flashback, she temporarily lost access to her post-
childhood knowledge and understanding.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2086 (Number of characters: 141):
This appears to be a mechanism of dissociation, and in
this instance, it rendered my client amnesiac of my high regard for our work together.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2087 (Number of characters: 161):
I believe this type of dissociation also accounts for the recurring disappearance of
previously established trust that commonly occurs with emotional flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2088 (Number of characters: 268):
As we progress in
our recovery, we learn that flashbacks can cause us to forget that our proven allies are in fact still
reliable. With enough practice, however, we can learn to interpret feelings of distrust with proven
friends as evidence that we are in a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2089 (Number of characters: 67):
We are flashing back to our childhoods when no
one was trustworthy.

Grieving Resolves Flashback

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2091 (Number of characters: 121):
[Step # 9]
Returning to the above vignette, I wondered out loud to my client, “Do you think you might be in
a flashback?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2092 (Number of characters: 156):
Because of the numerous times we had previously identified her emotional upsets
as flashbacks, she immediately recognized this and let go into deep sobbing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2093 (Number of characters: 360):
She dropped into

profound grieving. Her crying combined tears of relief with tears of grief. Her tears of relief came from being
able to take in my empathy. Her tears of grief were the feelings of her abject childhood pain
being released. Her tears of relief also came from once again remembering the source of this
previously confusing and overwhelming pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2094 (Number of characters: 80):
My client continued to cry and released more of the pain of her original trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2095 (Number of characters: 60):
Further
tears were about being stuck so often in flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2096 (Number of characters: 136):
As her tears subsided, she recalled a time as
a small child when she literally received a single lump of coal in her Christmas stocking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2097 (Number of characters: 79):
Mean
mom had “scrooged” her as punishment for being ten minutes late to dinner.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2098 (Number of characters: 121):
Her tears then
morphed into healthy anger about this abuse, and she felt herself returning to an empowered
sense of self.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2099 (Number of characters: 82):
Grieving brought her back into the present and broke the amnesia of the flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2100 (Number of characters: 62):
She then remembered to invoke her instinct of self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2101 (Number of characters: 79):
We had gradually been
rebuilding it with role-plays and assertiveness training.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2102 (Number of characters: 110):
She angrily vented about her parents’
destruction of her right to defend herself against abuse and unfairness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2103 (Number of characters: 48):
She started cheekily
chanting “That’s not fair!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2104 (Number of characters: 72):
as if to show her parents they could no longer attack her for saying it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2105 (Number of characters: 69):
She then moved further into reiterating her right to have boundaries.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2106 (Number of characters: 51):
She mocked mom and
dad as poor excuses for parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2107 (Number of characters: 87):
And then she turned her anger onto the critic with a resounding
refrain of saying “no”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2108 (Number of characters: 25):
“No, you cannot judge me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2109 (Number of characters: 37):
No, you cannot pick me apart anymore.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2110 (Number of characters: 58):
No
you cannot waste my time with all your stupid worries!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2111 (Number of characters: 108):
Finally, I reminded her to reinvoke her sense of safety by recognizing that she now
inhabited an adult body.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2112 (Number of characters: 37):
She was now free of parental control.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2113 (Number of characters: 104):
She had many resources to draw
on: intelligence, strength, resilience, and a growing sense of community.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2114 (Number of characters: 25):
She lived in a safe
home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2115 (Number of characters: 113):
She had the support of her therapist and two friends who were her allies and who readily
saw her essential worth.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2116 (Number of characters: 195):
I also observed that she was making ongoing progress in managing her flashbacks which
were occurring less often and less intensely. After about forty minutes, she was released from the flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2117 (Number of characters: 149):
I have witnessed this
restorative power of grieving on innumerable occasions. The intricacies of therapeutic grieving
will be explored in chapter 11.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2118 (Number of characters: 184):
Managing The Inner Critic [Step # 8]
When Cptsd survivors come of age and launch from the traumatizing family, they are often
unaware that their minds are dominated by an inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2119 (Number of characters: 170):
In assisting others to manage
flashbacks, the most common help I offer is to encourage them to challenge the alarmist and
perfectionistic programming of the inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2120 (Number of characters: 55):
This type of scenario arises frequently in my practice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2121 (Number of characters: 110):
A client, in the midst of reporting an
inconsequential mistake, suddenly launches into a catastrophizing tale.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2122 (Number of characters: 117):
He reports from his
critic’s nightmarish fantasy that his life is deteriorating into a cascading series of disasters.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2123 (Number of characters: 78):
He is
flashing back to the way he was continuously over-punished in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2124 (Number of characters: 131):
One of my client’s drasticizing sounded like this: “My boss looked at me funny when I
came back from my bathroom break this morning

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2125 (Number of characters: 65):
and I know he thinks I’m stupid and lazy and
is going to fire me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2126 (Number of characters: 47):
I just know I won’t be able to get another job.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2127 (Number of characters: 50):
My girlfriend will think I’m a
loser and leave me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2128 (Number of characters: 132):
I’ll get sick from the stress, and with no money to pay my medical insurance

and rent, I’ll soon be living out of a shopping cart.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2129 (Number of characters: 99):
It’s disturbing how many drasticizing inner
critic rants end with up with an image of homelessness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2130 (Number of characters: 29):
What a symbol of abandonment!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2131 (Number of characters: 143):
Recovering requires being able to recognize inner-critic catastrophizing so that we can
resist it with thought-stopping and thought-correction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2132 (Number of characters: 154):
In this case, I reminded my client of the
many times we had caught his critic “freaking out” about every conceivable way his life could go
down the tubes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2133 (Number of characters: 138):
I then encouraged him to refuse to indulge this process, and to angrily say “no”
to the critic every time it tried to scare or demean him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2134 (Number of characters: 85):
Finally, I reminded him of all the positive experiences he actually had with his boss

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2135 (Number of characters: 21):
[thought-correction].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2136 (Number of characters: 89):
I also helped him enumerate his many successes at work, at school and at
life in general.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2137 (Number of characters: 343):
The inner critic not only exacerbates flashbacks, but eventually grows into a psychic agency
that triggers them. Reversing the damaging effects of the critic is the subject of the next two
chapters
ADVANCED FLASHBACK MANAGEMENT
Waking Up In The Abandonment Depression
As recovery progresses, you notice more subtlety in the triggering process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2138 (Number of characters: 82):
As you do, you
become more mindful of your inner critic’s hard-to-detect triggers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2139 (Number of characters: 55):
You also discover that some
triggers are indiscernible.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2140 (Number of characters: 63):
This is especially true of triggering that occurs during sleep.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2141 (Number of characters: 177):
Advanced flashback management, then, involves learning how to manage the disconcerting
experience of falling asleep feeling reasonably put together and waking up in a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2142 (Number of characters: 257):
Typically this occurs because a dream has triggered you into a flashback. If you remember the
dream, you can sometimes figure out why it triggered you. With growing mindfulness you may
even understand which events from the previous day triggered your dream.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2143 (Number of characters: 77):
The most difficult situation to manage is when you cannot remember the dream.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2144 (Number of characters: 69):
This type
of flashback can feel particularly unfair and discouraging.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2145 (Number of characters: 129):
It is rich fodder for the critic, which
can declare that you are not only getting nowhere in his recovery, you are getting worse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2146 (Number of characters: 36):
Flashbacks As The Inner Child’s Plea

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2147 (Number of characters: 135):
For Help
With undetectable triggers, I find that it is most helpful to see a flashback as a communication
from the child that you were.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2148 (Number of characters: 112):
The child is reminding you that he woke up feeling desolate
innumerable times in that house that was not a home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2149 (Number of characters: 103):
He woke up daunted by the prospect of
once again having to reenter the poisonous milieu of your family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2150 (Number of characters: 124):
The child is now asking you to
meet his unmet need of having someone to go to for comfort when he wakes up feeling
wretched.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2151 (Number of characters: 31):
It is as if he is saying: “See!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2152 (Number of characters: 225):
This is how bad it was – this is how overwhelmed,
ashamed and miserable I felt so much of the time.”
Managing the pain of waking up in the abandonment depression is one of the most difficult,
long term challenges in recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2153 (Number of characters: 243):
Sleep seems to be a regressive, right-brain dominant
experience. It is not uncommon to wake up with a temporary loss of access to the left-brain
cognitive functions that control our more sophisticated understandings of our present-day reality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2154 (Number of characters: 111):
Without the latter, flashback management often reverts to the critic and our early childhood

attempts to cope.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2155 (Number of characters: 134):
This creates a fruitful ground for the critic to explode its arsenal of self-
pathologizing programs [enumerated in the next chapter].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2156 (Number of characters: 145):
Years ago, I customarily responded to awakening in flashback with hypochondriasizing
ruminations about my health: “What’s happening to my energy?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2157 (Number of characters: 42):
Something must be seriously
wrong with me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2158 (Number of characters: 30):
I feel like death warmed over.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2159 (Number of characters: 41):
That ache in my back is probably a tumor.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2160 (Number of characters: 29):
I lost
two pounds this month.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2161 (Number of characters: 23):
I just know its cancer!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2162 (Number of characters: 46):
I wish I could just die and get it over with.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2163 (Number of characters: 78):
This kind of drasticizing could and did sometimes go on for hours – even days.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2164 (Number of characters: 148):
Moreover, it
typically pulled me out of the abandonment depression by creating so much anxiety, that I was
forced out of bed into busyholic rushing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2165 (Number of characters: 159):
I would then hurry through the day unconsciously
rushing to outdistance myself from this awful thinking process, as well as the abandonment pain
underlying it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2166 (Number of characters: 114):
Because of a great deal of practice, I now quickly realize that hypochondriasizing means
that I am in a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2167 (Number of characters: 131):
Accordingly, I work to shift the focus of my thought processes to the
theme of generating love and kindness to the child within me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2168 (Number of characters: 141):
I dedicate this work to my
historical child who woke up countless times feeling horribly abandoned in my love-
impoverished family of origin.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2169 (Number of characters: 138):
For me, this is now my most practiced flashback management
process: breaking my merge with the critic to concentrate on caring for myself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2170 (Number of characters: 82):
There is another type of flashback message that seems to come from my inner child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2171 (Number of characters: 67):
It is that I
have slipped back into my old habit of neglecting him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2172 (Number of characters: 82):
Often it occurs when I ignore him by
regressing into overusing my flight response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2173 (Number of characters: 115):
My flashback then seems to be his clamoring for
some proof that my compassion for him is not merely empty rhetoric.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2174 (Number of characters: 152):
And typically when I slow
down and go inside, I find that old pain of self-abandonment - that old pain that I now think of as
“being lonely for myself.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2175 (Number of characters: 32):
Often this brings up some tears.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2176 (Number of characters: 62):
Almost as often, crying initiates a
release from my flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2177 (Number of characters: 141):
Flexible Use Of The Flashback Management Steps
Helen started her session in a deep state of self-alienation: “I am just such a hopeless case!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2178 (Number of characters: 75):
For
no reason at all, I got myself stuck in a terrible flashback yesterday.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2179 (Number of characters: 100):
And it wasn’t one of those
impossible-to-figure-out, waking up-flashbacks you keep telling me about.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2180 (Number of characters: 37):
I was fine all
morning, and then Bam!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2181 (Number of characters: 60):
I was in it up to here, and there wasn’t any stupid trigger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2182 (Number of characters: 18):
Nothing
caused it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2183 (Number of characters: 13):
It’s just me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2184 (Number of characters: 22):
Hopelessly screwed up!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2185 (Number of characters: 20):
Mentally defective!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2186 (Number of characters: 199):
Discerning the trigger of a flashback is a slippery slope. Seeing the trigger can often rescue
us from blaming and hating ourselves for the flashback, but there is not always an identifiable
trigger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2187 (Number of characters: 104):
In such situations, looking for the trigger can quickly deteriorate into self-pathologizing
vivisection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2188 (Number of characters: 100):
This slippery slope can quickly become a cliff as we plummet deeper into the abyss
of the flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2189 (Number of characters: 44):
It is almost always a matter of perspective.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2190 (Number of characters: 84):
Am I trigger-searching from a place of being on
my side or a place of fault-finding?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2191 (Number of characters: 156):
When it is the latter, it is best to abandon the search and
move toward invoking self-acceptance, as there will always be triggerings that are unfathomable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2192 (Number of characters: 97):
The process of self-support needs to trump the healthy urge to “figure it ALL out” at such times.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2193 (Number of characters: 172):
The process of self-acceptance also needs to trump any of your efforts to fix the flashback
when this striving becomes tainted with self-irritation and self-disappointment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2194 (Number of characters: 146):
Sometimes, as
described above, the best understanding you can achieve is an overarching one that your inner
child is feeling profoundly abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2195 (Number of characters: 151):
She is cowering from a humiliating attack from your
critic and needs for you to switch gears and demonstrate that you will care for her no matter
what.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2196 (Number of characters: 138):
Existential Triggers
Many psychologists use the term existential to describe the fact that all human beings are subject
to painful events.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2197 (Number of characters: 79):
These are normal recurring afflictions that everyone suffers from time to time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2198 (Number of characters: 135):
Horrible world events, difficult choices, illnesses and periodic feelings of abject loneliness are
common examples of existential pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2199 (Number of characters: 164):
Existential calamities can be especially triggering for
survivors, because we typically have so much family-of-origin calamity for them to trigger us
into reliving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2200 (Number of characters: 123):
Another particularly triggering existential phenomenon is the fact that we all suffer
invisible, unpredictable mood shifts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2201 (Number of characters: 60):
Good moods sometimes inexplicably deteriorate into bad
ones.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2202 (Number of characters: 106):
As novelist, David Mitchell wrote “Good moods are as fragile as eggs… and bad moods as
fragile as bricks”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2203 (Number of characters: 82):
Unpredictable shifts in your emotional weather are typically problematic in Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2204 (Number of characters: 67):
These
shifts can quickly trigger you into a full-fledged flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2205 (Number of characters: 112):
This is usually because you were
punished or abandoned in the past for showing your full complement of feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2206 (Number of characters: 96):
So now, out of
old habit, you automatically dissociate when your emotional weather is inclement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2207 (Number of characters: 215):
The inner child often experiences this as you reverting to the pre-recovery adult who had no
time for feelings. The child then feels that he is once again trapped in the past where he was so
devastatingly abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2208 (Number of characters: 78):
Perhaps, the resultant flashback is his only way to really get your
attention.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2209 (Number of characters: 146):
This is, again, why I try to make my default position turning to myself and my inner
child with unconditional positive regard as much as possible.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2210 (Number of characters: 491):
Later Stage Recovery
When your recovery matures sufficiently, you realize that much of the emotional pain of your
flashbacks is appropriate but delayed reactions to your childhood abuse and neglect. You process
your feelings in a way that resolves flashbacks, and also builds an increasingly healthy, sense of
self. This, in turn, leads to an ongoing reduction of the unresolved childhood pain that fuels your
emotional flashbacks. Flashbacks then become less frequent, intense and enduring.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2211 (Number of characters: 108):
Eventually,
you learn to invoke your self-protective instinct as soon as you realize that you are triggered.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2212 (Number of characters: 195):
As
flashbacks decrease and become more manageable, the defensive structures built around them
(narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, dissociative and/or codependent) are more readily
deconstructed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2213 (Number of characters: 124):
At this stage of your recovery, you may now experience an ironically satisfying experience
when you come out of a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2214 (Number of characters: 270):
You may sense on many levels of your awareness that life as
a child in your parents’ house was even worse than you realized. Simultaneously, you may feel a

corresponding sense of relief that you are now freer from your parents’ life-spoiling influence
than ever before.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2215 (Number of characters: 40):
HELPING KIDS MANAGE EMOTIONAL FLASHBACKS

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2216 (Number of characters: 120):
This list is for social workers, teachers, relatives, neighbors and friends to help children from
traumatizing families.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2217 (Number of characters: 62):
It is adapted from the steps at the beginning of this chapter.

SHRINKING THE INNER CRITIC
This chapter explores what one of my clients calls the “nasty and sneaky tricks of the critic.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2265 (Number of characters: 110):
ORIGIN OF THE CPTSD CRITIC
A flashback-inducing critic is typically spawned in a danger-ridden childhood home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2266 (Number of characters: 113):
This is true
whether the danger comes from the passive abandonment of neglect or the active abandonment
of abuse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2267 (Number of characters: 111):
When parents do not provide safe enough bonding and positive feedback, the child
flounders in anxiety and fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2268 (Number of characters: 244):
Many children appear to be hard-wired to adapt to this
endangering abandonment with perfectionism. A prevailing climate of danger forces the child’s superego to over-cultivate the various
programs of perfectionism and endangerment listed below.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2269 (Number of characters: 112):
Once again, the superego is the part
of the psyche that learns parental rules in order to gain their acceptance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2270 (Number of characters: 138):
The inner critic is the superego gone bad. The inner critic is the superego in overdrive
desperately trying to win your parents’ approval.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2271 (Number of characters: 128):
When perfectionist striving fails to win
welcoming from your parents, the inner critic becomes increasingly hostile and caustic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2272 (Number of characters: 113):
It festers
into a virulent inner voice that increasingly manifests self-hate, self-disgust and self-
abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2273 (Number of characters: 206):
The inner critic blames you incessantly for shortcomings that it imagines to be the
cause of your parents’ rejection. It is incapable of understanding that the real cause lies in your
parents’ shortcomings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2274 (Number of characters: 122):
As a traumatized child, your over-aroused sympathetic nervous system also drives you to
become increasingly hypervigilant.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2275 (Number of characters: 323):
Hypervigilance is a fixation on looking for danger that comes
from excessive exposure to real danger. In an effort to recognize, predict and avoid danger,
hypervigilance is ingrained in your approach to being in the world. Hypervigilance narrows your
attention into an incessant, on-guard scanning of the people around you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2276 (Number of characters: 92):
It also frequently
projects you into the future, imagining danger in upcoming social events.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2277 (Number of characters: 113):
Moreover,

hypervigilance typically devolves into intense performance anxiety on every level of self-
expression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2278 (Number of characters: 105):
Like the soldier overlong in combat, ptsd sets in because you feel as if you are constantly
under attack.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2279 (Number of characters: 145):
Unfortunately, internal attack is now added to external attack, and you become
locked into hypervigilance and sympathetic nervous system arousal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2280 (Number of characters: 91):
A traumatized child becomes desperate to relieve the anxiety and depression of abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2281 (Number of characters: 84):
The critic-driven child can only think about the ways she is too much or not enough.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2282 (Number of characters: 80):
The child’s
unfolding sense of self [the healthy ego], finds no room to develop.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2283 (Number of characters: 42):
Her identity virtually
becomes the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2284 (Number of characters: 28):
The superego trumps the ego.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2285 (Number of characters: 186):
In this process, the critic becomes increasingly virulent and eventually switches from the
parents’ internalized voice: “You’re a bad boy/girl” to the first person: “I’m a bad boy/girl.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2286 (Number of characters: 69):
Over time, self-goading increasingly deteriorates: “I’m such a loser.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2287 (Number of characters: 59):
I’m so pathetic… bad...
ugly…worthless…stupid...defective.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2288 (Number of characters: 73):
This is unlike the soldier in combat who does not develop a toxic critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2289 (Number of characters: 102):
This process
whereby the superego becomes carcinogenic is a key juncture where ptsd morphs into Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2290 (Number of characters: 78):
The cruel, totalitarian inner critic is a key distinguishing feature of Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2291 (Number of characters: 402):
One of my clients grief-fully remembered the constant refrains of his childhood: “If only I
wasn’t so needy and selfish…if only my freckles would fade...if only I could pitch a perfect
game...if only I could stop gagging on the canned peas during dinner...if only I could pray all the
time to get mom’s arthritis cured, then maybe she’d stop picking on me, and then maybe dad
would play catch with me.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2292 (Number of characters: 135):
In my work with survivors, I am continuously struck by how often the inner critic triggers them
into overwhelming emotional flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2293 (Number of characters: 101):
The Cptsd-derived inner critic weds our fear of
abandonment to our self-hate about our imperfections.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2294 (Number of characters: 81):
It then tortures us with the entwined
serpents of perfectionism and endangerment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2295 (Number of characters: 88):
Endangerment is the process of constantly
projecting danger onto safe enough situations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2296 (Number of characters: 107):
Your recovering depends on learning how to recognize and confront the 14 inner critic
attacks listed below.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2297 (Number of characters: 193):
When this process of recovering is bypassed, these deeply engrained
programs continue to send you tumbling back into the overwhelming fear, shame and
hopelessness of your childhood abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2298 (Number of characters: 30):
14 COMMON INNER CRITIC ATTACKS

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2299 (Number of characters: 103):
[Each attack/program is paired with a therapeutic thought-correction response]
Perfectionism Attacks
1.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2300 (Number of characters: 142):
Perfectionism. My perfectionism arose as an attempt to gain safety and support in my

dangerous family. Perfection is a self-persecutory myth.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2301 (Number of characters: 63):
I do not have to be perfect to be safe or
loved in the present.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2302 (Number of characters: 57):
I am letting go of relationships that require perfection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2303 (Number of characters: 67):
I have a right to
make mistakes. Mistakes do not make me a mistake.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2304 (Number of characters: 106):
Every mistake or mishap is an opportunity to
practice loving myself in the places I have never been loved.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2305 (Number of characters: 42):
2. All-or-None & Black-and-White Thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2306 (Number of characters: 75):
I reject extreme or over-generalized
descriptions, judgments or criticisms.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2307 (Number of characters: 87):
One negative happenstance does not mean I am stuck in a
never-ending pattern of defeat.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2308 (Number of characters: 98):
Statements that describe me as “always” or “never” this or that,
are typically grossly inaccurate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2314 (Number of characters: 244):
I turn shame back into blame and disgust, and
externalize it to anyone who shames my normal feelings and foibles. As long as I am not hurting
anyone, I refuse to be shamed for normal emotional responses like anger, sadness, fear and
depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2315 (Number of characters: 101):
I especially refuse to attack myself for how hard it is to completely eliminate the self-
hate habit.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2316 (Number of characters: 2):

they do not.

“God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to
change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” - The Serenity Prayer

Guilt.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2337 (Number of characters: 41):
Feeling guilty does not mean I am guilty.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2338 (Number of characters: 53):
I refuse to make my decisions and choices
from guilt.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2339 (Number of characters: 52):
Sometimes I need to feel the guilt and do it anyway.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2340 (Number of characters: 153):
In the inevitable instances when I
inadvertently hurt someone, I will apologize, make amends, and let go of my guilt. I will not
apologize over and over.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2341 (Number of characters: 24):
I am no longer a victim.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2342 (Number of characters: 31):
I will not accept unfair blame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2343 (Number of characters: 101):
Guilt is
sometimes camouflaged fear: “I feel guilty and afraid, but I am not guilty or in danger.”

“Shoulding”.

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2346 (Number of characters: 41):
Over-productivity/Workaholism/Busyholism.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2385 (Number of characters: 35):
Perseverating About Being Attacked.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2386 (Number of characters: 110):
Unless there are clear signs of danger, I will

The vast majority of my fellow

--------------------------------------------------

I have legal authorities to aid in my protection if threatened
by the few who aren’t.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2389 (Number of characters: 61):
I invoke thoughts and images of my friends’ love and support.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2390 (Number of characters: 52):
Critic attacks like most things are not all-or-none.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2391 (Number of characters: 40):
They can vary in intensity and duration.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2392 (Number of characters: 77):
Most
of the case examples that follow are on the intense end of the spectrum.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2393 (Number of characters: 75):
I chose them because
they are more illustrative of how the critic operates.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2394 (Number of characters: 144):
Once you become proficient at identifying
intense critic attacks, you typically develop the mindfulness necessary to notice more subtle
attacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2395 (Number of characters: 133):
This is essential because most survivors spend tremendous amounts of time barely
conscious of how incessantly self-critical they are.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2396 (Number of characters: 151):
As with the flashback management steps, memorizing these rebuttals to the critic and using
them like mantras is especially helpful in critic shrinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2397 (Number of characters: 135):
Critic-initiated Flashbacks
The inner critic commonly increases the intensity of a flashback via a barrage of the attacks
listed above.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2398 (Number of characters: 86):
Flashbacks can devolve into increasingly painful levels of the abandonment
depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2399 (Number of characters: 99):
One attack can repetitively bleed into another and tumble us further down a spiral of
hopelessness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2400 (Number of characters: 120):
It is awful enough to take a single punch in a fight, but when the punches keep
coming, the victim is severely thrashed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2401 (Number of characters: 70):
Once again, Cptsd flashbacks do not typically have a visual component.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2402 (Number of characters: 135):
However, it is not
unusual for a survivor to sometimes flash on a snapshot of a parent’s contemptuous face at the
moment of triggering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2403 (Number of characters: 155):
My client, Dmitri, began his session by telling me that he was contentedly puttering around
his kitchen when he accidentally knocked over a glass of water.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2404 (Number of characters: 100):
He immediately pictured his
father and a loud internal voice blurted: “I’m such a world class spaz!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2405 (Number of characters: 79):
Retrospectively, he realized that he then plummeted instantly into a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2406 (Number of characters: 120):
Anxiety

quickly overwhelmed him and he was soon lost in a tirade of self-attacking diatribes emanating
from the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2407 (Number of characters: 72):
“Spaz” is an example of the name-calling that the critic specializes in.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2408 (Number of characters: 57):
It is a
combination of critic attacks # 1, 3 and 9 above.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2409 (Number of characters: 89):
The attacks soon deteriorated into a full scale laundry listing of all his imperfections.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2410 (Number of characters: 83):
These
were characteristically blown out of proportion, and often not reality based.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2411 (Number of characters: 36):
The critic screamed:
“I’m so clumsy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2412 (Number of characters: 52):
I never do anything right [#2 all-or-none thinking].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2413 (Number of characters: 31):
“I could f*ck up a free
lunch!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2414 (Number of characters: 193):
Quickly, Dmitri’s thinking was totally dominated by a negative focus[#11] that merged
with drasticizing [#10], and culminated in attack fantasies [#14] that made him cancel his plans
to go out.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2415 (Number of characters: 100):
This example is only a micro-portion of the unending onslaught that can accompany a
major flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2416 (Number of characters: 131):
After enduring many, many more elaborations of this process, Dmitri became
entrenched in the ultimate abandonment catastrophization

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2417 (Number of characters: 102):
[#10]: “No wonder I don’t have a
partner or any friends; who could tolerate being around such a loser”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2418 (Number of characters: 39):
[#2: He actually had two
good friends].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2419 (Number of characters: 70):
Dmitri’s felt-sense of abandonment then morphed into self-abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2420 (Number of characters: 112):
Primitive self-
soothing behaviors reemerged as he self-medicated by binging on an enormous amount of junk
food.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2421 (Number of characters: 81):
He then retreated into his bedroom to dissociate further into a long morning nap.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2422 (Number of characters: 70):
All this in reaction to the tiny faux pas of a spilled glass of water!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2423 (Number of characters: 124):
I must emphasize here that Dmitri was not crazy or defective because his critic made a hell
out of a spilled glass of water.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2424 (Number of characters: 137):
All this was a re-visit via flashback to the real traumatic
experiences of being profoundly rejected by his parents for trivial mistakes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2425 (Number of characters: 87):
His father had
contemptuously told him he could f*ck up a free lunch innumerable times.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2426 (Number of characters: 137):
As Dmitri resolved and harvested the learning potential of this flashback, he said to me:
“Pete, I can’t tell you how horrible they were.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2427 (Number of characters: 63):
Life at home was one no-win, mind-f*ck situation
after another.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2428 (Number of characters: 40):
F*cked if I did, and f*cked if I didn’t.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2429 (Number of characters: 111):
It’s no wonder I’ve been stuck all these
years with this ball and chain code: ‘Don’t ever let down your guard!’

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2430 (Number of characters: 216):
Something’s just moved in
me and I swear I’m gonna start cutting myself some slack!”
Thoughts As Triggers
Rejecting parents typically make the child believe that his opinions and feelings are dangerous
imperfections.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2431 (Number of characters: 74):
In worst case scenarios the mere impulse to speak triggers fear and shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2432 (Number of characters: 77):
How
could anything the child says not reveal his stupidity and worthlessness?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2433 (Number of characters: 67):
Opening his mouth
invariably leads to deeper rejection and trouble.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2434 (Number of characters: 185):
As ongoing neglect and abuse repetitively strengthen the critic, even the most innocuous,
self-interested thought or musing can trigger a five alarm fire of intense emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2435 (Number of characters: 152):
To
maintain the illusive hope of someday winning parental approval, the child’s perfectionistic
striving escalates, and may become obsessive/compulsive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2436 (Number of characters: 55):
Even an imagined mistake can then
initiate a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2437 (Number of characters: 206):
The Critic As The Shaming Internalized Parents
Not infrequently, a client comes into a session and shamefully confesses something that sounds

like this: “I called myself a f*ckwit over and over last night.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2438 (Number of characters: 80):
I must really be inherently messed
up, because I know my mother never said that.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2439 (Number of characters: 78):
As bad as she was, she never swore and I doubt
she ever even heard that word.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2440 (Number of characters: 69):
The explanation for this is that the critic is essentially a process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2441 (Number of characters: 145):
It is an ever developing
process that co-opts our creativity and funnels it into “new and improved” ways of imitating our
parents’ disparagement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2442 (Number of characters: 150):
Parental contempt is the key piece of the emotional abuse that creates toxic shame. Toxic
shame is the emotional matrix of the abandonment depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2443 (Number of characters: 65):
It is also the glue that keeps us
stuck helplessly in flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2444 (Number of characters: 73):
As such, toxic shame is the affect or emotional tone of the inner
critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2445 (Number of characters: 90):
Shame besmirches us as it emotionally intensifies each of the 14 assaults described above.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2446 (Number of characters: 229):
In main stream psychology, shame is often described as a social emotion. Normal shame is
a somewhat healthy, self-regulating emotional reaction that arises when someone witnesses us
acting in an unfair, offensive, or hurtful way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2447 (Number of characters: 46):
This is not the case with toxic shame however.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2448 (Number of characters: 124):
Many Cptsd survivors in recovery soon
realize that they do not need a witness to suddenly be catapulted into a shame attack.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2449 (Number of characters: 52):
Dmitri was all alone when he knocked over the glass.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2450 (Number of characters: 10):
Or was he?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2451 (Number of characters: 323):
There is an invisible social context to toxic shame attacks. Toxic shame is social
because the inner critic came into existence through pathological interactions with our parents. Moreover, toxic shame is social in the moment of the solitary flashback, because at the time it is
as if we are in the presence of our parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2452 (Number of characters: 103):
For me, the strongest evidence of this occurs when I am on my own and trying to do
something difficult.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2453 (Number of characters: 143):
If I make a mistake or do not accomplish my task as efficiently as possible, I
often feel very anxious as if I am being watched and criticized.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2454 (Number of characters: 77):
I believe this phenomenon corresponds with an internalization of our parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2455 (Number of characters: 140):
Our parents
were such formative and formidable presences in our developing life, that we have strong
representations of them in our psyches.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2456 (Number of characters: 70):
These representations include their beliefs and
condemnation about us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2457 (Number of characters: 132):
Until we work on shrinking their influence, our internalized parents exist
in our psyches as the key controlling force of our lives.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2458 (Number of characters: 122):
Facing The Stubbornness Of The Critic
The work of shrinking the critic is one of the most essential processes of recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2459 (Number of characters: 152):
As obvious as
its value may seem as you read this, embracing the task of renouncing the critic is much more
challenging than it may seem at first blush.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2460 (Number of characters: 160):
The critic’s programs are not only burned deeply into our psyches by our parents, but we
also unknowingly emblazon them into our minds by mimicking our parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2461 (Number of characters: 60):
We are now the key
reinforcing agents of their toxic legacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2462 (Number of characters: 119):
With little mindfulness of it, we injure ourselves with
countless angry, self-disgusted repetitions of their judgments.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2463 (Number of characters: 124):
Recovery now depends on you
withdrawing your blind allegiance to this terrible process of only noticing yourself negatively.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2464 (Number of characters: 65):
The task of diminishing these self-negating patterns is daunting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2465 (Number of characters: 106):
It is typically lifetime work
– often negotiable only at the rate of two-steps-forward, one-step backward.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2466 (Number of characters: 73):
And oh how unfair
it is that the step backward often feels more like six!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2467 (Number of characters: 35):
Yet recent findings in neuroscience

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2468 (Number of characters: 182):
[The General Theory of Love; The Talking Cure] have
shown that biologically ingrained mental patterns can be diminished and replaced with new ones

through long term repetitive work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2469 (Number of characters: 162):
I believe this is analogous to adding or subtracting girth to
parts of your physique, which typically takes seemingly innumerable repetitions of a given
exercise.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2470 (Number of characters: 132):
In the last couple of decades my brain has gone from being my own worst enemy almost all
the time to being very reliably on my side.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2471 (Number of characters: 85):
I have also seen similar gains with many of the clients
I have worked with long-term.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2472 (Number of characters: 447):
Perfectionism And Emotional Neglect As stated earlier, perfectionism also seems to be an instinctual defense for emotionally
abandoned children. The existential impossibility of perfection saves the child from giving up,
unless or until lack of success forces her to retreat into a dissociative freeze response or an anti-
social fight response. Perfectionism also provides a sense of meaning and direction for the powerless and
unsupported child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2473 (Number of characters: 68):
Striving to be perfect offers her a semblance of a sense of control.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2474 (Number of characters: 159):
Self-
control is also safer to pursue because abandoning parents typically reserve their severest
punishment for children who are vocal about their negligence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2475 (Number of characters: 303):
As the quest for perfection fails over and over, and as parental acceptance and nurturing
remain elusive, imperfection becomes synonymous with shame and fear. Perceived imperfection
triggers fear of abandonment, which triggers self-hate for imperfection, which expands
abandonment into self-abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2476 (Number of characters: 84):
This in turn amps fear up even further, which in turn
intensifies self-disgust, etc.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2477 (Number of characters: 78):
On and on it goes in a downward spiral of fear and shame-encrusted
depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2478 (Number of characters: 110):
It can go on for hours, days, weeks, and for those with severe Cptsd, can become
their standard mode of being.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2479 (Number of characters: 109):
More On Endangerment
The importance and magnitude of the critic’s endangerment programs cannot be overstated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2480 (Number of characters: 185):
I
have worked with numerous “well-therapized” people who were relatively free from
perfectionism, but still seriously afflicted with the critic’s addiction to noticing potential danger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2481 (Number of characters: 341):
Said another way, I have seen survivors eliminate much of their perfectionist, self-attacking
thinking without realizing that the critic was still flooding their minds with fear-inducing
thoughts and images. I learned to disidentify from perfectionism long before I learned to stop perseverating on
my critic’s harrowing snapshots of danger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2482 (Number of characters: 107):
In fact, I became quite adept at morphing these
snapshots into feature long films about my imminent demise.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2483 (Number of characters: 166):
Permanent abandonment, public humiliation, lethal illness, lonely death, imminent attack,
and penniless homelessness are common endangerment themes of many survivors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2484 (Number of characters: 110):
One of my
clients identified his inner critic endangerment process as: “My critic, the horror movie
producer”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2485 (Number of characters: 46):
This made me think: “My critic the terrorist”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2486 (Number of characters: 80):
If I had to describe the two most key processes of the critic, I would say this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2487 (Number of characters: 88):
First, the critic
is above all a self-perpetuating process of extreme negative noticing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2488 (Number of characters: 134):
Second the critic is a
constant hypervigilance that sees disaster hovering in the next moment about to launch into a
full-court-press.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2489 (Number of characters: 158):
Using Anger To Thought-Stop The Critic
Thought-stopping is the process of using willpower to disidentify from and interrupt toxic
thoughts and visualizations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2490 (Number of characters: 88):
Sometimes visualizing a stop sign at the same time can help
strengthen thought-stopping.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2491 (Number of characters: 155):
Since traumatizing parents cripple the instinctive fight response of their child, recovering
the anger of the fight response is essential in healing Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2492 (Number of characters: 92):
We need the aid of our fight
response to empower the process of thought-stopping the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2493 (Number of characters: 194):
I cannot over-encourage you to use your anger to stop the critic in its tracks. We can re-
hijack the anger of the critic’s attack, and forcefully redirect it at the critic instead of ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2494 (Number of characters: 138):
We can then silently and internally say “No!” or “Stop!” or “Shut Up!” to short-circuit
drasticizing and perfectionistic mental processes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2495 (Number of characters: 100):
Angrily saying “No!” to the critic sets an internal boundary against unnatural, anti-self
processes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2496 (Number of characters: 93):
It is the hammer of self-renovating carpentry that rebuilds our instinct of self-
protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2497 (Number of characters: 168):
Furthermore recovery is deepened by directing our anger at anyone who helped
install the critic, as well as at anyone who is currently contributing to keeping it alive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2498 (Number of characters: 252):
I recently received this e-mail from a website respondent who read some of my writing about
angering at the critic: “Another explanation I really liked is for people that don’t have much of
the FIGHT response to start using it to stop the inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2499 (Number of characters: 88):
I am a huge fan of self-compassion
which has really helped me recently (loving-kindness)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2500 (Number of characters: 73):
and I continually just accept all the
messages and just let them flow by.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2501 (Number of characters: 125):
When I heard your comments about saying NO and rejecting
them, I was like ‘Yeah- I guess Pete maybe hasn’t found it all yet.’

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2502 (Number of characters: 25):
I was being close minded.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2503 (Number of characters: 63):
A
couple days later I tried it out and Oh My Gog has it helped.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2504 (Number of characters: 13):
I get mad now

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2505 (Number of characters: 67):
and it just shuts
down my anxiety and turns shame into blame/anger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2506 (Number of characters: 28):
It feels much better for me!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2507 (Number of characters: 102):
After all it
wasn’t messages I would have given to myself, and they are all messages from my parents.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2508 (Number of characters: 91):
Successful critic-shrinking usually requires thousands of angry skirmishes with the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2509 (Number of characters: 105):
Passionate motivation for this work often arises when we construct an accurate picture of our
upbringing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2510 (Number of characters: 136):
Natural anger eventually arises when we really get how little and defenseless we
were when our parents bullied us into hating ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2511 (Number of characters: 113):
Most trauma survivors were blank slates who were brainwashed into accepting the critic as
their primary identity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2512 (Number of characters: 88):
To the degree that a family is Cptsd-engendering, to that degree is it like a
mini-cult.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2513 (Number of characters: 74):
Cults demand absolute loyalty to the leader’s authority and belief system.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2514 (Number of characters: 182):
In early
thought-stopping work, most survivors need to empower their efforts with a healthy rage against
their parents for destroying their self-loyalty and their self-individuation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2515 (Number of characters: 123):
However, with enough
practice, the survivor’s healthy observing ego can use willpower alone to disidentify from the
critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2516 (Number of characters: 108):
My son’s birth graced me with an enormous boost in my motivation to practice thought-stopping
on the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2517 (Number of characters: 118):
Witnessing the many miracles of his ongoing development moved me to
increasingly deepen my emotional bonding with him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2518 (Number of characters: 100):
This was quite disconcerting to my critic
which began working overtime on its endangerment programs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2519 (Number of characters: 93):
The critic warned me interminably about the danger of my rapidly expanding attachment to
him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2520 (Number of characters: 146):
It was trying to protect me from the devastation that would ensue if my loving emotional
investment turned out as badly as it did with my parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2521 (Number of characters: 70):
What if untrustworthy “Life” let him
die or rendered him a “bad seed.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2522 (Number of characters: 131):
The critic manufactured the most dreadful horror movies of accidents, diseases, kidnapping,
mental illness, oedipal betrayals, etc.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2523 (Number of characters: 174):
Had I not known how to recognize, interpret and refuse to
indulge these catastrophizations, I am sure that my capacity to bond with him would have been
seriously compromised.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2524 (Number of characters: 150):
Moreover, had I not been able to use my outrage to disidentify from the
critic, thought-stopping by itself would not have been a powerful enough tool.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2525 (Number of characters: 55):
I particularly like this way of challenging the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2526 (Number of characters: 44):
“I’m not afraid of you anymore, mom and
dad.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2527 (Number of characters: 50):
You were the critic, and you put the critic in me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2528 (Number of characters: 31):
I renounce your toxic messages.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2529 (Number of characters: 33):
Take back
your shame and disgust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2530 (Number of characters: 50):
I am disgusted at your shameful job of parenting.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2531 (Number of characters: 115):
One of my clients shared with me a phrase that spontaneously came to her while she was
fighting her critic at home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2532 (Number of characters: 98):
“You totally ruined my childhood, and I’m not going to let you get
away with ruining my life now.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2533 (Number of characters: 122):
She reported that this perspective emblazoned in her
consciousness, and now often helps to fire her up to fire the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2534 (Number of characters: 204):
Shame Is Blame Unfairly Turned Against The Self
The great psychologist, Erik Eriksen, gave us a great tool when he formulated this emotional
mathematics equation. “Shame is blame turned against the self”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2535 (Number of characters: 85):
Our parents were too big and
powerful to blame, so we had to blame ourselves instead.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2536 (Number of characters: 132):
Now, however we are free of them,
and we can cut off the critic’s shame supply by redirecting unfair self-blame back to our parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2537 (Number of characters: 170):
You can redirect the anger of the critic’s blaming messages away from you. You can direct
the anger onto the installers of the critic, or sideways onto the critic itself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2538 (Number of characters: 221):
You can give shame
back by allowing yourself to feel angry and disgusted at the image of your parent bullying you. You can rage at them for overwhelming you with shame when you were too young and small to
defend yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2539 (Number of characters: 116):
An inner critic that has dominated us since childhood, however, does not give up its
rulership of the psyche easily.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2540 (Number of characters: 142):
It stubbornly refuses to accept the updated information that
adulthood now offers the possibility of increasing safety and healthy attachment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2541 (Number of characters: 102):
It is as if the
critic has worn a flashback-inducing groove in the brain the size of the Grand Canyon.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2542 (Number of characters: 131):
Now, any
of the thinking patterns listed earlier can hair-trigger an amygdala-hijacking that dumps us into
the abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2543 (Number of characters: 86):
Progress in critic-shrinking is often infinitesimally slow and indiscernible at first.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2544 (Number of characters: 85):
Our
brains have become addicted to only noticing what is wrong and what is dangerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2545 (Number of characters: 99):
And as with
most addictions, breaking this deeply entrenched habit may require lifelong management.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2546 (Number of characters: 133):
In early recovery work, we need to challenge the critic’s monocular negative focus over and
over with all the ferocity we can muster.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2547 (Number of characters: 137):
Eventually with practice we can find a part of ourselves
that is mad about how grossly unfair our parents’ bullying and indifference was.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2548 (Number of characters: 135):
We can find a
part of us that is outraged that we were indoctrinated and inculcated into chronically abandoning
and bullying ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2549 (Number of characters: 103):
We can fume that this occurred when we were too young to protest or
even know what was happening to us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2550 (Number of characters: 62):
We can gradually build our ability to say “No!” and “Shut
up!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2551 (Number of characters: 42):
whenever we catch the critic attacking us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2552 (Number of characters: 291):
With enough healthy inner self-defense, the survivor gradually learns to reject her
unconscious acceptance of self-abuse and self-abandonment. Her sense of healthy self-protection
begins to emerge and over time grows into a fierce willingness to stop unfair criticism - internal
or external.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2553 (Number of characters: 177):
Psychologically speaking, this is part of the process of working through repetition
compulsion. Deconstructing repetition compulsion has both an internal and external dimension.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2554 (Number of characters: 273):
On the internal dimension, we decrease the habit of repetitively perpetrating our parents’ abuse
against ourselves by staunchly confronting the inner critic. This then allows us to become more
mindful on the external dimension when others reenact our parents’ mistreatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2555 (Number of characters: 65):
We can then
confront them to stop, or banish them from our lives.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2556 (Number of characters: 131):
With enough practice, we can repudiate our
parents’ awful legacy of teaching us that love means numbly accepting abuse and neglect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2557 (Number of characters: 179):
Further encouragement and guidance for therapeutically angering at the critic can be found
in Soul Without Shame, by Byron Brown, and Healing Your Emotional Self by Beverly Engel.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2558 (Number of characters: 213):
Embracing The Critic
In my experience, until the fight response is substantially restored, the Cptsd client benefits little
from CBT, psychodynamic or mindfulness techniques that encourage us to accept the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2559 (Number of characters: 126):
In
later recovery, when the survivor has removed the venomous stinger from the critic, these
techniques can be quite valuable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2560 (Number of characters: 93):
Then, and only then, are we able to reconnect with the helpful
side of healthy self-criticism

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2561 (Number of characters: 57):
[see Stone and Stone’s book Embracing Your Inner Critic].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2562 (Number of characters: 124):
A typical indication that the critic has mellowed into being functional is that it speaks to us
in a kind and helpful voice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2563 (Number of characters: 104):
It reminds us dispassionately to adjust our behavior when we can and
ought to be doing something better.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2564 (Number of characters: 123):
If, however, it blasts us for imperfection, it is giving itself
away as the toxic critic that was installed by our parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2565 (Number of characters: 171):
A left-brained, objective approach of embracing the critic is rarely helpful unless it is
balanced with a subjective, right-brained capacity for assertive self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2566 (Number of characters: 127):
Perhaps this is
because the inner critic appears to operate simultaneously with hyper-emotional right-brain
flashback dynamics.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2567 (Number of characters: 157):
Perhaps toxic inner critic processes are so emotionally overwhelming that
efforts to resist them rationally and dispassionately are too weak to be effective.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2568 (Number of characters: 193):
THOUGHT-SUBSTITUTION AND THOUGHT-CORRECTION
Thought-substitution, especially in the form of thought-correction, is another essential tool for
empowering the work of thought-stopping the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2569 (Number of characters: 109):
Many years ago, I sensed that my critic
became as tough as a body-builder’s bicep through myriad repetitions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2570 (Number of characters: 118):
I guessed that similarly
exercising self-protective responses to the critic would build my thought-correction muscles.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2571 (Number of characters: 127):
It

did in fact, and my instinct to protect myself almost always arises automatically now when I am
triggered into a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2572 (Number of characters: 174):
I believe I am not exaggerating when I say that tens of thousands of
positive thought-substitutions have rewarded me with a psyche that is fairly consistently user-
friendly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2573 (Number of characters: 158):
Accordingly, I encourage you to immediately confront the critic’s negative messages with
positive ones like those in the list at the beginning of the chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2574 (Number of characters: 195):
This is essential in Cptsd
recovery, because a single unconfronted toxic thought can act like a virus and rage infectiously
out of control into a flu-like mélange of shame, fear and helplessness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2575 (Number of characters: 133):
Moving quickly into thought-stopping and thought correction often obviates a headlong
tumble into the downward spiral of a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2576 (Number of characters: 122):
This is essential in critic-work, as the critic
typically attacks us more viciously once it has gotten up a head of steam.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2577 (Number of characters: 120):
At such times, the critic
can hypocritically scorn us for falling back into self-criticism when we “should” know better.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2578 (Number of characters: 127):
This is the time then, more than ever, to “thought-correct and not self-berate,” as my last intern
liked to say to her clients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2579 (Number of characters: 149):
Additionally, I encourage you to write out a list of your positive qualities and
accomplishments to read it to yourself if you get lost in self-hate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2580 (Number of characters: 106):
Toolbox 5 in chapter 16 is a
practical exercise to help you elaborate this list in a multidimensional way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2581 (Number of characters: 166):
Making a written record of your positive attributes is especially helpful as flashbacks often
create a temporary amnesia about your essential worthiness and goodness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2582 (Number of characters: 90):
Flashbacks seem to
involve a temporary loss of access to more current left-brain learning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2583 (Number of characters: 80):
MRI’s show greatly
reduced left-brain activity in hyper-aroused Cptsd survivors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2584 (Number of characters: 87):
In my experience, memorizing your
list enhances your capacity to dissolve that amnesia.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2585 (Number of characters: 153):
Reciting part or all of your list over and over like a mantra can also help you during those
times when the critic is particularly severe and relentless.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2586 (Number of characters: 106):
If you have trouble making the list or
filling out Toolbox 5, ask a friend or a therapist for their input.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2587 (Number of characters: 120):
Additionally, please let me
remind you that qualities do not have to be perfect or ever-present to qualify as qualities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2588 (Number of characters: 60):
If it is
true of you most of the time then, it is a quality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2589 (Number of characters: 82):
Finally, positive visualization can be a powerful adjunct to thought-substitution.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2590 (Number of characters: 221):
Some
survivors gradually learn to short-circuit the fear-mongering processes of the critic by invoking
images of past successes and accomplishments, as well as picturing safe places, loving friends or
comforting memories.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2591 (Number of characters: 191):
There are also a variety of CD’s available at places like Amazon.com that
contain guided meditations that use positive language and imagery in a way that enhances
deactivation and relaxation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2592 (Number of characters: 201):
Perspective-Substitution And Correction
The most important thought correction of all is a switch in the perspective of our thinking. Perspective-substitution is a broadening of our overall perspective.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2593 (Number of characters: 239):
It moves our viewpoint
from the critic’s narrow, negative focus to the more balanced and accurate focus of the observing
ego – the mindful self. Perspective-substitution helps us to dethrone the critic from its life-negating point of view.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2594 (Number of characters: 164):
This resembles the firing of a bad manager or inept coach – one with a distorted view who dwells
so much on what is wrong that he cannot see anything that is right.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2595 (Number of characters: 107):
As stated in chapter 1, perspective-substitution can be enhanced with the spiritual practice

of gratitude.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2596 (Number of characters: 343):
In this vein, gratitude is a type of mindfulness that looks for empirical proof that life
is essentially good even though it is also quite difficult at times. Perspective-Substitution And Gratitude
Gratitude is a delicate subject to write about because many survivors have been abused by
shaming advice to “just be grateful for what you have”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2597 (Number of characters: 123):
Consequently many survivors totally
reject the concept of gratitude and throw the baby out with the scorn-sodden bathwater.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2598 (Number of characters: 111):
Once
again, this is quite understandable when you legitimately had little to be grateful for in your
childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2599 (Number of characters: 123):
Moreover, the concept of gratitude is damagingly used by some psychologists to support the
psychological defense of denial.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2600 (Number of characters: 67):
They tout gratitude as a fast track that can bypass traumatic
pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2601 (Number of characters: 58):
This is worse than absurd when applied to Cptsd survivors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2602 (Number of characters: 147):
It is in fact shamefully abusive
to survivors because profound, extended trauma cannot be resolved until it is fully understood
and worked through.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2603 (Number of characters: 378):
Gratitude is nevertheless a wonderful natural experience that can recurrently enhance the
quality of your life. You can cultivate a perspective that is open to noticing what there is to be
grateful about as long as you do not do it with the intention of creating a permanent feeling of
gratitude. Over time an attitude of gratitude can gradually increase authentic gratefulness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2604 (Number of characters: 54):
This can best be illustrated with the example of love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2605 (Number of characters: 151):
While it is of course healthy to adopt a
cognitive attitude of love toward our friends and chosen family, it is impossible to feel loving all
the time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2606 (Number of characters: 109):
If I expect that of myself, I give my inner critic endless fodder to attack me for not
feeling loving enough.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2607 (Number of characters: 138):
Similarly if I expect myself to feel grateful all the time, I keep the critic’s
prodigious program of self-disappointment hale and hearty.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2608 (Number of characters: 86):
Nonetheless, aligning with attitudes like love and gratitude is generally therapeutic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2609 (Number of characters: 425):
When I
am temporarily stuck in a flashback feeling alienated from life, remembering what I am usually
grateful for in life can sometimes pull me out of the polarized negative thinking that helps keep
the flashback alive. Invoking gratitude is particularly difficult, and often impossible at first, because flashbacks
typically strand us in an emotional overwhelm that cancels out our ability to feel anything good
about life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2610 (Number of characters: 121):
Reminding ourselves of what is worthwhile in our lives does not seem to help much in
the early phases of using this tool.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2611 (Number of characters: 293):
However, with enough practice of positive-noticing, we can
sometimes relax out of a flashback by invoking our memories of gratitude. When I experience this at the end of an especially long flashback, positive-noticing
sometimes arises spontaneously and brings with it sweet tears of gratitude.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2612 (Number of characters: 151):
These are also
typically tears of relief, and tears of an achieved sense of belonging. These tears typically arise unbidden, seemingly out of the blue.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2613 (Number of characters: 303):
Typically they are
positively triggered by experiences of beauty or connection, such as when flowers authentically
strike me as beautiful once again, or when my appreciation of music returns and deeply moves
my soul, or when I suddenly fully feel how much I love my wife, my son, my friend or my client.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2614 (Number of characters: 467):
After a painful lapse in being able to emotionally enjoy these experiences, this return brings
these gratitude-laden tears which on really momentous occasions can vacillate between crying
and laughing as I resurface into authentically being grateful to be alive. Once again, my experience is that the more I practice the thought substitution of focusing on
what I am grateful for, the sooner genuine gratitude returns to me on the occasions that I lose
touch with it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2615 (Number of characters: 64):
A powerful way to practice perspective-correction is as follows.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2616 (Number of characters: 79):
After you go to bed at
night, list at least ten positive happenings of the day.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2617 (Number of characters: 112):
More often than not these will not be peak
experiences, but rather basic and simple pleasures and appreciations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2618 (Number of characters: 302):
They may be as simple as a
catchy tune, an engaging color, a sweet scent, an enjoyable food serving of the day, a new flower
in a local garden, a satisfying TV show, a neighbor’s hello, a feeling of fitness climbing the
stairs, soothing words from a favorite author, or a pleasant encounter with a pet.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2619 (Number of characters: 113):
Decades of this practice have helped me immeasurably to upgrade the sour perspective I
inherited from my parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2620 (Number of characters: 140):
Alignment with this function of the healthy observing ego provides us
with a more balanced and accurate perception of life and other people.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2621 (Number of characters: 243):
The Neuroplasticity Of The Brain
I am repeatedly heartened to read the accumulating evidence from neuroscience research that
proves the neuroplasticity of the brain. Neuroplasticity means that the brain can grow and change
throughout our life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2622 (Number of characters: 95):
Old self-destructive neural pathways can be diminished and new healthier
ones can replace them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2623 (Number of characters: 74):
A General Theory of Love by Thomas Lewis inspiringly explicates this
fact.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2624 (Number of characters: 198):
This fact helps me to remember that the critic can indeed literally be shrunk via longterm,
frequent and dedicated use of the thought-stopping, thought-substitution and thought-correction
practices.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2625 (Number of characters: 96):
As recovery progresses, you notice the critic sooner before its attack becomes multidimensional.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2626 (Number of characters: 67):
This then allows you to take more immediate self-protective action.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2627 (Number of characters: 131):
Moreover, Cptsd flashbacks
can be utilized as evidence of, and in later stages of recovery, proof of your childhood
traumatization.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2628 (Number of characters: 136):
Flashbacks point irrefutably to the fact that your parent’s abandonment forced
you to habituate to hypervigilance and negative noticing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2629 (Number of characters: 144):
SHRINKING THE OUTER CRITIC
THE OUTER CRITIC: THE ENEMY OF RELATIONSHIP
In Cptsd, the critic can have two aspects: inner critic and outer critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2630 (Number of characters: 260):
The inner critic is the part
of your mind that views you as flawed and unworthy. The outer critic is the part that views
everyone else as flawed and unworthy. When the outer critic is running your mind, people
appear to be too awful and too dangerous to trust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2631 (Number of characters: 109):
When she was stuck in an outer critic attack, one of my clients would often rant like this:
“Everybody s*cks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2632 (Number of characters: 32):
People are so selfish and scary.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2633 (Number of characters: 48):
They either f*ck you over or they let you
down.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2634 (Number of characters: 70):
She eventually named this an “I’m-moving-to-another-planet flashback.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2635 (Number of characters: 79):
The outer critic is the counterpart of the self-esteem-destroying inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2636 (Number of characters: 120):
It uses the same
programs of perfectionism and endangerment against others that your inner critic uses against
yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2637 (Number of characters: 132):
Via its all-or-none programming, the outer critic rejects others because they are never
perfect and cannot be guaranteed to be safe.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2638 (Number of characters: 129):
As with the inner critic, outer critic attacks are usually internal and silent, unless you are a
fight type as we will see below.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2639 (Number of characters: 71):
When we regress into the outer critic, we obsess about the unworthiness

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2640 (Number of characters: 34):
[imperfection] and
treacherousness

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2641 (Number of characters: 26):
[dangerousness] of others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2642 (Number of characters: 73):
Unconsciously, we do this to avoid emotional
investment in relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2643 (Number of characters: 355):
The outer critic developed in reaction to parents who were too dangerous to trust. The outer
critic helped us to be hyperaware of the subtlest signal that our parents were deteriorating into
their most dangerous behaviors. Over time the outer critic grew to believe that anyone and
everyone would inevitably turn out to be as untrustworthy as our parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2644 (Number of characters: 89):
Now, in situations where we no longer need it, the outer critic alienates us from others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2645 (Number of characters: 141):
It
attacks others and scares them away, or it builds fortresses of isolation whose walls are laundry
lists of their exaggerated shortcomings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2646 (Number of characters: 101):
In an awful irony, the critic attempts to protect us from

abandonment by scaring us further into it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2647 (Number of characters: 128):
If we are ever to discover the comfort of soothing connection with others, the critic’s
dictatorship of the mind must be broken.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2648 (Number of characters: 114):
The outer critic’s arsenal of intimacy-spoiling dynamics
must be consciously identified and gradually deactivated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2649 (Number of characters: 267):
4F TYPES AND OUTER CRITIC/INNER CRITIC RATIOS
Depending on your 4F type, you may gravitate to either the inner or the outer critic. Different 4F
types generally have different ratios of outer and inner critic dynamics, and some polarize
extremely to one or the other.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2650 (Number of characters: 63):
Freeze and Fight types are often polarized to the outer critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2651 (Number of characters: 52):
Fawn types tend to be
dominated by the inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2652 (Number of characters: 72):
Flight types can have the most variance in inner and outer critic
ratio.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2653 (Number of characters: 51):
Your subtype can also have a big influence on this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2654 (Number of characters: 128):
The Freeze type can judgmentally denounce the entire outside world to justify her all-or-
none belief that people are dangerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2655 (Number of characters: 127):
The Flight type can use his own perfectionistic striving to
excel so that his outer critic can judge everyone else as inferior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2656 (Number of characters: 126):
The Fawn type uses inner critic
self-hate to self-censor and avoid the fear of being authentic and vulnerable in relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2657 (Number of characters: 270):
The
Fight type, in a paradoxical twist, controls others through the outer critic to prevent them from
abandoning him while at the same time using prickliness to not let them get too close. Fight types can also leave at the first sign that the other cannot be controlled.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2658 (Number of characters: 100):
One flight-
fight type, who I worked with briefly, told me with great upset about a recent betrayal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2659 (Number of characters: 132):
His new
partner “insisted” on replacing the empty toilet paper roll so that the new roll unwound from the
bottom instead of the top.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2660 (Number of characters: 107):
He asked her once to do it his way and felt so betrayed when she did
not comply, that he broke up with her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2661 (Number of characters: 66):
I could not help feeling that she was fortunate that she got
away.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2662 (Number of characters: 102):
Unfortunately, this client was not able to take in that the lion’s share of his upset was a
flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2663 (Number of characters: 132):
He had flashed back to his rigidly controlling mother frightening him into believing
that the toilet paper must unwind from the top.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2664 (Number of characters: 68):
She had punished him into believing that this was
a universal truth.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2665 (Number of characters: 79):
Perfectionism, in the hands of the outer critic, can be paranoiacally picayune.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2666 (Number of characters: 180):
Finally it is not unusual for survivors, who have significantly shrunk their dominant critic mode,
to experience a reciprocal increase in the virulence of its opposite counterpart.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2667 (Number of characters: 142):
This came as a
disappointing shock to me at a time when I was congratulating myself that my inner critic was a
mere shadow of its former self.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2668 (Number of characters: 99):
Soon thereafter, I noticed that I was plagued by a new
judgmentalness that seemed out of character.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2669 (Number of characters: 121):
Curiosity and a growing mindfulness about this
development lead me to a lot of the insights that I share in this chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2670 (Number of characters: 158):
With enough
mindfulness, this shift in critic mode can then become an opportunity to further shrink the overall
combined agency of the outer and inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2671 (Number of characters: 122):
PASSSIVE-AGGRESSIVENESS AND THE OUTER CRITIC
Children are initially wired to respond angrily to parental abuse or neglect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2672 (Number of characters: 130):
Outside of the fight

types, most traumatized children learn early that protesting parental unfairness is an
unpardonable offense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2673 (Number of characters: 67):
They are generally forced to repress their protests and complaints.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2674 (Number of characters: 52):
This
then renders their anger silent and subliminal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2675 (Number of characters: 39):
This anger however, does not disappear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2676 (Number of characters: 147):
It
percolates as an ever accumulating sea of resentment that can fuel the outer critic’s obsession for
finding fault and seeing danger in everyone.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2677 (Number of characters: 111):
Viewing all relationships through the lens of parental abandonment, the outer critic never
lets down its guard.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2678 (Number of characters: 149):
It continuously transfers unexpressed childhood anger onto others, and
silently scapegoats them by blowing current disappointments out of proportion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2679 (Number of characters: 167):
Citing
insignificant transgressions as justification, the survivor flashes back into outer critic mode, and
silently fumes and grumbles in long judgmental ruminations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2680 (Number of characters: 70):
To bastardize Elizabeth Barrett
Browning: “How do I find thee lacking?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2681 (Number of characters: 23):
Let me count the ways.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2682 (Number of characters: 231):
When silently blaming the wrong person becomes habitual, it manifests as passive-
aggressiveness. Common examples of passive aggression are distancing yourself in hurt
withdrawal, or pushing others away with backhanded compliments.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2683 (Number of characters: 134):
Other examples include poor
listening, hurtful teasing disguised as joking, and the withholding of positive feedback and
appreciation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2684 (Number of characters: 135):
Chronic lateness and poor follow through on commitments can also be
unconscious, passive-aggressive ways of expressing anger to others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2685 (Number of characters: 242):
Refusing To Give Voice To The Critic’s Point Of View
The outer critic is the author of this intimacy-spoiling program: Being honest to a fault. In the
guise of honesty, the outer critic can negatively notice only what is imperfect in another.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2686 (Number of characters: 129):
Under
the spell of perfectionism, the outer critic can tear the other apart by laundry-listing his normal
weaknesses and foibles.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2687 (Number of characters: 96):
When challenged about this many fight types will respond that: “I was
just trying to be honest!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2688 (Number of characters: 108):
The inner critic has its own version of excessive honesty which I sometimes call “beating
you to the punch.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2689 (Number of characters: 190):
Afraid of being criticized [as in childhood], the inner critic can launch the
survivor into a “confession” of her every defect in hopes of short-circuiting anyone else from
bringing them up.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2690 (Number of characters: 99):
Sometimes hearing the criticism from yourself feels less hurtful than hearing it
from someone else.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2691 (Number of characters: 48):
After all, it’s old news to you and your critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2692 (Number of characters: 240):
I subscribe to authenticity as one of my highest values, but it does not include sharing my
outer critic’s view of you or exposing my inner critic’s unfair judgments of me. As stated earlier, the toxic critic is not an authentic part of us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2693 (Number of characters: 25):
We were not born with it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2694 (Number of characters: 98):
We
were indoctrinated with it by parents who viewed us in an extremely negative and jaundiced
way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2695 (Number of characters: 95):
Because of this, we need to protect our intimates from its distorted and destructive
judgments.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2696 (Number of characters: 158):
Just as importantly, we need to protect ourselves from alienating people by
presenting ourselves as if we are so defective that we do not deserve to be loved.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2697 (Number of characters: 129):
OUTER CRITIC-DOMINATED FLASHBACKS
Holly, an elderly client and a flight-fight type, was suffering minor, age-related memory loss.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2698 (Number of characters: 100):
She started her session chuckling: “I was reading your article on the Outer Critic again last night.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2699 (Number of characters: 71):
I didn’t really get it when I read it three years ago, but I get it now

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2700 (Number of characters: 69):
and I think it’s because my
memory deterioration has a silver lining.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2701 (Number of characters: 85):
“So, you know how I’m always blaming my husband whenever anything goes wrong at
home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2702 (Number of characters: 92):
Well I’m starting to get that it’s an all-or-none, outer critic process that I get stuck in.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2703 (Number of characters: 144):
“I’ve been blaming him for misplacing or not putting things away for decades but I’ve
started to notice that it’s me who often misplaces things.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2704 (Number of characters: 104):
I was cooking a meal last night and
looking for the food scissors that I use to cut up leafy vegetables.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2705 (Number of characters: 192):
It wasn’t on the magnetic wall
strip where I insist that we keep it, and I immediately started feeling very angry at him - and
more and more angry as I searched in various drawers to no avail.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2706 (Number of characters: 115):
“The longer I searched, the more exasperated I got, and sure enough, I found myself
laundry-listing all his faults.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2707 (Number of characters: 107):
My resentment rapidly escalated and peaked with me deciding that I
really was going to leave him this time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2708 (Number of characters: 182):
As I continued to amass evidence that he was a terrible
loser and that this was a wise decision, I went back to the stove and found the scissors where I’d
left them five minutes ago.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2709 (Number of characters: 85):
I could see the scraps of spinach still on them from when I’d cut it up
over the pot!

chunk 2710 (Number of characters: 34):
“What a mortifying epiphany I had!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2711 (Number of characters: 86):
- Especially since a similar thing had happened with
the tooth paste the night before.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2712 (Number of characters: 145):
I forgot I had put it in the medicine cabinet in one of my
organizational upgrades, and I was convinced Frank had moved it from its proper place.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2713 (Number of characters: 106):
I started
reading him the riot act so intensely, that he pretended he had to get something out of the car.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2714 (Number of characters: 106):
And then, when I went to the medicine cabinet for some aspirin, there it was where I had placed
it myself!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2715 (Number of characters: 87):
“Oh my god, that outer critic did an instant about face into becoming the inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2716 (Number of characters: 194):
And
then when it had contemptuously lambasted me to tears, I suddenly had another epiphany about
how I would let any mistake on his part launch me into a two volume history of his past
mistakes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2717 (Number of characters: 160):
I’d get so stuck in that negative noticing that I couldn’t call to mind a single good thing
about this good enough husband that I’ve had for thirty-five years.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2718 (Number of characters: 57):
Holly and I spent a great deal of time fleshing this out.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2719 (Number of characters: 182):
She could see that the outer critic
typically triggered her into a very old feeling and belief that “People are so unreliable – they
always let you down –they just can’t be trusted!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2720 (Number of characters: 126):
We then moved into exploring her childhood, looking for clues as to where this belief that
people were so untrustworthy began.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2721 (Number of characters: 100):
She closed her eyes, took a few deep breaths, and when she
opened them tears trickled down her face.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2722 (Number of characters: 67):
“It was Father – Daddy - that incredibly selfish,
alcoholic a-hole.

never do it again.

chunk 2725 (Number of characters: 31):
He’d even let me go off on him!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2726 (Number of characters: 32):
Oh my God, just like poor Frank!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2727 (Number of characters: 27):
Just sit
there and take it.

chunk 2728 (Number of characters: 15):
Only poor Frank

chunk 2729 (Number of characters: 55):
[more tears], he’s never done anything like that to me.

--------------------------------------------------

He’s
pretty reliable in most ways, except for not being as organized as me.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2731 (Number of characters: 165):
OUTER CRITIC MODELLING IN THE MEDIA
Outer critic entrenchment is also difficult to dislodge because its parlance is normalized, and
worse, celebrated in our society.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2732 (Number of characters: 67):
Skewering people seems to be standard practice in most TV
comedies.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2733 (Number of characters: 168):
Moreover, many influential, seemingly healthy adults model a communication style
that is rife with judgmentalness, sarcasm, negativity, fear-mongering and scapegoating.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2734 (Number of characters: 149):
Giving control of our social interactions to the outer critic prohibits the cultivation of the
vulnerable communication that makes intimacy possible.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2735 (Number of characters: 251):
We must renounce unconscious outer

critic strategies such as: [1] “I will use angry criticism to make you afraid of me, so I can be safe
from you”; [2] “Why should I bother with people when everyone is so selfish and corrupt” [all-
or-none thinking];

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2736 (Number of characters: 232):
[3] “I will perfectionistically micromanage you to prevent you from betraying
or abandoning me”; [4] “I will rant and rave or leave at the first sign of a lonely feeling, because
‘if you really loved me, I would never feel lonely’”.

chunk 2737 (Number of characters: 124):
The Critic: Subliminal B-Grade Movie Producer
The outer critic typically arises most powerfully during emotional flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2738 (Number of characters: 134):
At such times, it
transmutes unconscious abandonment pain into an overwhelmingly negative perception of
people and of life in general.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2739 (Number of characters: 97):
It obsessively fantasizes, consciously and unconsciously, about how
people have or could hurt us.

--------------------------------------------------

Over the years these fantasies typically expand from scary snapshots into film clips and
even movies.

--------------------------------------------------

Without realizing it, we can amass a video collection of real and imagined
betrayals that destroy our capacity to be nurtured by human contact.

chunk 2742 (Number of characters: 315):
“Don’t trust anyone”, “Proud to be a loner”, “You can only depend on yourself”, “Lovers
always leave you”, “Kids will break your heart”, “Only fools let on what they really think”,
“Give them an inch and they’ll take a mile”, are titles of video themes survivors may develop in
their quest for interpersonal safety.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2743 (Number of characters: 162):
These defensive and often subliminal daydreams are analogs of the critic-spawned
nightmares that also shore up the “safety” work of frightening us into isolation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2744 (Number of characters: 175):
Over time, with
enough recovery, intrusive anti-intimacy reveries become clues that we are actually in a
flashback, and that we need to invoke our flashback management skills.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2745 (Number of characters: 79):
The dynamics of the outer critic are often obscured by minimization and denial.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2746 (Number of characters: 80):
Its obsessions
and “daymares” often occur just below the level of our awareness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2747 (Number of characters: 226):
They become subliminal via
their repetitiveness like the sound of waves at the beach - like the sounds of traffic in the city -
like the sound of the critic repetitively calling you or someone else a jerk, a loser, a dumbsh*t!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2748 (Number of characters: 158):
Watching The News As A Trigger
Sometimes the outer critic’s penchant for raising false alarms ensnares us with an insatiable
hunger for listening to the news.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2749 (Number of characters: 181):
When we do not resist this junk food feeding of our psyches
with a news “service” that exults so thoroughly in the negative, we can be left floundering in a
dreadful hypervigilance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2750 (Number of characters: 102):
The critic can then work overtime to amass irrefutable proof that the world is unforgivably
dangerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2751 (Number of characters: 80):
Isolation, and minimal or superficial relating, is therefore, our only recourse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2752 (Number of characters: 131):
At such
times any inclination to call a friend triggers images of rejection and humiliation before the
phone can even be picked up.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2753 (Number of characters: 156):
When flashbacks are particularly intense, impulses to venture out
may immediately trigger fantasies of being verbally harassed or even mugged on the street.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2754 (Number of characters: 158):
In worse case scenarios, outer critic drasticizing deteriorates into paranoia. At its worst
paranoia deteriorates into fantasies and delusions of persecution.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2755 (Number of characters: 131):
I remember one horribly,

humiliating experience that occurred in my early twenties on an occasion when I was very sleep-
deprived.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2756 (Number of characters: 82):
I was sitting on a park bench struggling to concentrate on the book I was reading.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2757 (Number of characters: 82):
I had
read the same short paragraph four times and barely registered a word of it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2758 (Number of characters: 101):
At the same time, I
was becoming more and more aware of a group of people who had sat down behind me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2759 (Number of characters: 122):
I started
feeling ashamed because they were having a great time while I sat there painfully self-conscious
and despondent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2760 (Number of characters: 61):
Suddenly I realized they were talking disparagingly about me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2761 (Number of characters: 32):
I was too scared to turn
around.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2762 (Number of characters: 46):
Their comments became steadily more insulting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2763 (Number of characters: 48):
Their loud laughter became
increasingly mocking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2764 (Number of characters: 12):
In my mind’s

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2765 (Number of characters: 5):
I eye

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2766 (Number of characters: 79):
I could see them all staring and pointing at me: “Look
at that sorry-ass loser.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2767 (Number of characters: 41):
He’s pretending he’s not even listening!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2768 (Number of characters: 82):
Finally, in desperation, I turned
around and croaked out a weak “What’s going on?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2769 (Number of characters: 55):
I was shocked and even more mortified at the same time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2770 (Number of characters: 33):
They were not even looking at
me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2771 (Number of characters: 106):
They were so immersed in their joyful banter that they did not even notice that I turned
around and spoke.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2772 (Number of characters: 85):
It became immediately obvious to me that it was a terrible figment of my
imagination.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2773 (Number of characters: 134):
I slunk away in shame and had to wait decades to understand how my Cptsd and the
outer critic had manufactured this terrible paranoia.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2774 (Number of characters: 29):
INTIMACY AND THE OUTER CRITIC

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2775 (Number of characters: 135):
As stated earlier, Cptsd typically includes an attachment disorder that comes from the absence of
a sympathetic caregiver in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2776 (Number of characters: 138):
When the developing child lacks a supportive parental
refuge, she never learns that other people can soothe loneliness and emotional pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2777 (Number of characters: 79):
She never
learns that real intimacy grows out of sharing all of her experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2778 (Number of characters: 177):
To the degree that our caretakers attack or abandon us for showing vulnerability, to that
degree do we later avoid the authentic self-expression that is fundamental to intimacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2779 (Number of characters: 105):
The outer
critic forms to remind us that everyone else is surely as dangerous as our original caretakers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2780 (Number of characters: 145):
Subliminal memories of being scorned for seeking our parents’ support then short-circuit our
inclinations to share our troubles and ask for help.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2781 (Number of characters: 120):
Even worse, retaliation fantasies can plague us for hours and days on the occasions when
we do show our vulnerabilities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2782 (Number of characters: 108):
I once experienced this after being very honest and vulnerable in
a job interview with a committee of eight.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2783 (Number of characters: 187):
Over the next three insomnia-plagued nights, my outer
critic ran non-stop films featuring my interviewers’ contempt about everything I had said, and
disgust about all that I had left out.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2784 (Number of characters: 181):
Even after they subsequently and enthusiastically hired me,
the outer critic plagued me with “imposter syndrome” fantasies of eventually being exposed as
incompetent in the new job.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2785 (Number of characters: 134):
The No-Win Situation
While scaring us out of trusting others, the outer critic also pushes us to over-control them to
make them safer.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2786 (Number of characters: 123):
Over-controlling behaviors include shaming, excessive criticism, monologing
[conversational control] and overall bossiness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2787 (Number of characters: 97):
An extreme example of the latter is the no-win
situation, which is also known as the double bind.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2788 (Number of characters: 80):
It is described in the vernacular as “damned if
you do, and damned if you don’t.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2789 (Number of characters: 55):
”[Only the most severe fight types do this consciously.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2790 (Number of characters: 103):
These
types are found on the end of the narcissistic continuum where narcissism turns into sociopathy.]

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2791 (Number of characters: 92):
Sterling was a fight type client of mine who was strongly narcissistic, but not sociopathic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2792 (Number of characters: 158):
He wanted me to prove that I was meticulously attending to his pause-less monologue by giving
him an empathic “un hunh” at about the rate of once a paragraph.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2793 (Number of characters: 205):
He would usually cue me to do
this by ending a sentence with “You Know?”
Over time, I could usually tell when he was in a flashback because he would be bothered by
the frequency or quality of my “un hunh.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2794 (Number of characters: 71):
He was alternately frustrated if I used too many or too
few “un hunhs”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2795 (Number of characters: 82):
In the first instance he fumed: “Haven’t you ever heard of a rhetorical
question?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2796 (Number of characters: 128):
In the alternate instance, his frustration flared out at my lack of sympathy because I
was not responding with “un hunh” enough.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2797 (Number of characters: 57):
There is an inner critic version of the no-win situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2798 (Number of characters: 79):
Howard came into a session with a 102
temperature and a raging case of the flu.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2799 (Number of characters: 113):
He told me: “I was lying in bed fluctuating between the
sweats and the chills, and the critic was kicking my ass.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2800 (Number of characters: 32):
‘You lazy, flakey piece of sh*t!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2801 (Number of characters: 32):
Stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2802 (Number of characters: 53):
Get off your sorry ass and get to your appointment!’”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2803 (Number of characters: 106):
Howard then told me that he fought this for about fifteen minutes, but the critic finally won
and he came.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2804 (Number of characters: 82):
As he sat in my waiting room, the critic started in again: “You are such an idiot.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2805 (Number of characters: 55):
How could you be so stupid to go out feeling like this?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2806 (Number of characters: 59):
You masochistic loser, you’re just trying
to kill yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2807 (Number of characters: 196):
Why do you even bother trying to get better?”
Scaring Others Away
To avoid the vulnerability of being close, the outer critic can also broadcast from the various
inner critic endangerment program.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2808 (Number of characters: 116):
Catastrophizing out loud can be very triggering to others and
can be an unconscious way of making them afraid of us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2809 (Number of characters: 109):
One of my basketball-playing acquaintances is addicted to listening to a local, doom-and-
gloom news station.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2810 (Number of characters: 120):
He has managed to alienate everyone in our gym by his non-stop
proselytizing about the catastrophic demise of our times.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2811 (Number of characters: 155):
One of the players joked that he will
not pass him the ball anymore because he thinks the guy believes that it is impossible for it to go
through the hoop.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2812 (Number of characters: 157):
Survivors who unnecessarily frighten others by excessively broadcasting about all the
possible things that could go wrong rarely endear themselves to others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2813 (Number of characters: 137):
Moreover, they “force”
others to avoid and abandon them when their negative noticing reaches a critical mass and
becomes noise pollution.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2814 (Number of characters: 220):
VACILLATING BETWEEN OUTER AND INNER CRITIC
Many Cptsd survivors flounder in caustic judgmentalness, shuffling back and forth between
pathologizing others [the toxic blame of the outer critic] and pathologizing themselves

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2815 (Number of characters: 38):
[the toxic
shame of the inner critic].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2816 (Number of characters: 107):
They get stuck in endless loops of detailing the relational inadequacies
of others, and then of themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2817 (Number of characters: 110):
My parents’ twisted version of this boiled down to: “As f*cked up as we are, we’re still way
better than you”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2818 (Number of characters: 136):
Karen Horney described this trauma two-step as all-or-none lurching between

the polarities of the grandiose self and the despised self.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2819 (Number of characters: 114):
When we become lost in this process, we miss out on our crucial emotional need to
experience a sense of belonging.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2820 (Number of characters: 123):
We live in permanent estrangement oscillating between the
extremes of too good for others or too unlikeable to be included.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2821 (Number of characters: 142):
This is the excruciating social
perfectionism of the Janus-faced critic: others are too flawed to love and we are too defective to
be lovable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2822 (Number of characters: 70):
A verbal diagram of a typical critic-looping scenario looks like this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2823 (Number of characters: 126):
The outer critic’s
judgmentalness is activated by the need to escape the “in-danger” feeling that is triggered by
socializing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2824 (Number of characters: 105):
Even the thought of relating can set off our disapproval programs so that we feel
justified in isolating.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2825 (Number of characters: 89):
Extended withdrawal however, reawakens our relational hunger and our
impulses to connect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2826 (Number of characters: 65):
This simultaneously reverses the critic from outer to inner mode.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2827 (Number of characters: 108):
The critic
then laundry lists our inadequacies, convincing us that we are too odious to others to socialize.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2828 (Number of characters: 168):
This then generates self-pitying persecution fantasies, which eventually re-invites the outer critic
to build a case about how awful people are…ad infinitum…ad nauseam.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2829 (Number of characters: 72):
This looping then keeps
us “safe” in the hiding of silent disengagement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2830 (Number of characters: 92):
When it emanates from the inner critic direction, the vacillating critic can look like this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2831 (Number of characters: 73):
The
survivor’s negative self-noticing drives her to strive to be perfect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2832 (Number of characters: 84):
She works so hard and
incessantly at it that she begins to resent others who do not.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2833 (Number of characters: 147):
Once the resentment accumulates
enough, a minor faux pas in another triggers her to shift into extreme outer critic disappointment
and frustration.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2834 (Number of characters: 93):
She then silently perseverates and laundry lists “people” for all their faults and
betrayals.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2835 (Number of characters: 231):
How long she remains polarized to the outer critic usually depends on her 4F type, but
sooner or later she starts to feel guilty about this, and suddenly the inner critic is back on line
judging her harshly for being so judgmental.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2836 (Number of characters: 59):
The cataloguing of her own defects then resumes in
earnest.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2837 (Number of characters: 104):
A Case Example Of The Vacillating Critic
My wife and I have been living together for more than a decade.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2838 (Number of characters: 199):
We have come a long way in
negotiating what seems to both of us - most of the time – a fair and flexible approach to handling
the innumerable tasks involved in running a household with a young child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2839 (Number of characters: 128):
But sometimes, when
I am experiencing an extended flashback, I start over-noticing imperfections in the general
household order.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2840 (Number of characters: 48):
Where the critic first points the finger varies.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2841 (Number of characters: 122):
If I am triggered into tired survival mode, the
inner critic can launch into berating me for my sub-standard contribution.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2842 (Number of characters: 123):
If on the other hand I
am triggered into flight mode and have been speed-cleaning, my outer critic can start keeping
score.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2843 (Number of characters: 102):
In this latter mode, my outer critic can perseverate about how little my wife is doing
compared to me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2844 (Number of characters: 89):
The comparisons are typically in the areas where I have recently been over-
contributing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2845 (Number of characters: 132):
But my fawn side is pretty strong and before too long, I can start noticing all the venues
where I do not contribute as much as she.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2846 (Number of characters: 52):
And suddenly I am the selfish slacker of the family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2847 (Number of characters: 96):
As
the flashback continues, I may then flip into berating myself for being picky and ungenerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2848 (Number of characters: 224):
In an especially strong flash back, the outer critic will come back sooner or later and start
assigning more weight and importance to my contributions, and then belittle her for being, slack,
thoughtless, self-involved, etc.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2849 (Number of characters: 146):
In our early relationship I could loop this loop for quite some time, losing hours even days
to feeling disaffected from my wife, and from myself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2850 (Number of characters: 145):
My peace of mind would deteriorate into
an inner battleground of feeling abandoned by her while simultaneously judging myself for
abandoning her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2851 (Number of characters: 105):
In the worst flashbacks, the process did not stay internal, and we would have
conflicts about this issue.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2852 (Number of characters: 46):
These days conflict rarely occurs over chores.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2853 (Number of characters: 115):
Because of what I have learned about the
outer critic, internal looping about this has also decreased immeasurably.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2854 (Number of characters: 154):
Mindfulness about my
outer and inner critic processes allows me to identify them sooner and rescue myself and my
relationship from them much more quickly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2855 (Number of characters: 88):
The scenario above is also a typical example of what worrying looks like in a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2856 (Number of characters: 100):
THE CRITIC AS JUDGE, JURY AND EXECUTIONER
As noted above, not all survivors hide their outer critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2857 (Number of characters: 100):
Fight types and subtypes can take the
passive out of passive-aggressive and become quite aggressive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2858 (Number of characters: 158):
The survivor who is polarized to
the outer critic often develops a specious belief that his subjectively derived standards of
correctness are objective truth.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2859 (Number of characters: 145):
When triggered, he can use the critic’s combined detective-
lawyer-judge function to prosecute the other for betrayal with little or no evidence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2860 (Number of characters: 153):
Imagined
slights, insignificant peccadilloes, misread facial expressions, and inaccurate “psychic”
perceptions can be used to put relationships on trial.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2861 (Number of characters: 82):
In the proceedings, the outer critic typically
refuses to admit positive evidence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2862 (Number of characters: 72):
Extenuating circumstances will not be considered in this
kangaroo court.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2863 (Number of characters: 121):
Moreover any relational disappointment can render a guilty verdict that
sentences the relationship to capital punishment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2864 (Number of characters: 73):
This is also the process by which jealousy can
become toxic and run riot.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2865 (Number of characters: 108):
On another level, the outer critic is skilled at building a case to justify occupying a higher
moral ground.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2866 (Number of characters: 81):
From this lofty position, the critic then claims the right to micromanage others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2867 (Number of characters: 65):
Typically this is rationalized as being for the other’s own good.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2868 (Number of characters: 146):
This control, however, is usually
wielded on an unconscious level to protect the survivor from any reenactment of early parental
abuse or neglect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2869 (Number of characters: 77):
Micromanagement of others also devolves into a host of controlling behaviors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2870 (Number of characters: 220):
Fight types
treat others like captive audiences, give them unsolicited performance evaluations, make
unreasonable demands for improvement, and control their time schedules, social calendars and
food and clothing choices.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2871 (Number of characters: 87):
In worse case scenarios, they dramatically act out their jealousy, often
without cause.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2872 (Number of characters: 93):
At its absolute worst, outer critic relating looks like taking prisoners, not making
friends.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2873 (Number of characters: 202):
Scapegoating
Scapegoating is an outer critic process whereby personal frustration is unfairly dumped onto
others. Scapegoating is typically fuelled by unworked through anger about childhood
abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2874 (Number of characters: 98):
Displacing anger on the wrong target however, fails to release or resolve old or

unrelated hurts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2875 (Number of characters: 63):
Scapegoating is often a reenactment of a parent’s abusive role.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2876 (Number of characters: 101):
It is blind imitation of a
parent who habitually released his frustration by indiscriminately raging.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2877 (Number of characters: 95):
When a fight type
parent scapegoats those around him, he enforces a perverse kind of mirroring.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2878 (Number of characters: 64):
He is making sure
that when he feels bad, so does everyone else.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2879 (Number of characters: 88):
It is like a bumper sticker I saw the other day: “If
Momma ain’t happy, Nobody’s happy.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2880 (Number of characters: 78):
I witnessed this common example of scapegoating several times in my childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2881 (Number of characters: 37):
My
parents hated anyone who was late.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2882 (Number of characters: 142):
If one of us children were even a minute late for something,
they felt absolutely justified in blasting us with their “righteous” indignation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2883 (Number of characters: 76):
This was true even
though we all learned very quickly to be anally punctual.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2884 (Number of characters: 139):
Because of their untreated Cptsd
however, their anger was the tip of the iceberg of their unexpressed rage about their own
childhood hurts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2885 (Number of characters: 259):
In this case, they were flashing back to the pain of their parents’ chronic
lateness and failure to show up to meet their normal childhood needs.
MINDFULNESS AND SHRINKING THE OUTER CRITIC
Reducing outer critic reactivity requires a great deal of mindfulness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2886 (Number of characters: 173):
This is as essential for fight
types who act out aggressively, as it is for those trauma types who internally rant against the
entire human group known as “F*cking People!”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2887 (Number of characters: 128):
It is also of great importance for any survivor
who is locked into alienation because of the judgmentalness of his outer critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2888 (Number of characters: 165):
Mindfulness, once again, is the process of becoming intricately aware of everything that is
going on inside us, especially thoughts, images, feelings and sensations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2889 (Number of characters: 251):
In terms of outer critic
work, it is essential that we become more mindful of both the cognitive and emotional content of
our thoughts. This is the same as in inner critic work, where the two key fronts of critic shrinking are
cognitive and emotional.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2890 (Number of characters: 137):
Cognitive work in both cases involves the demolition and rebuilding
processes of thought-stopping and thought substitution, respectively.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2891 (Number of characters: 52):
And, emotional work in
both instances is grief work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2892 (Number of characters: 125):
It is removing the critic’s fuel supply - the unexpressed childhood
anger and the uncried tears of a lifetime of abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2893 (Number of characters: 160):
When Mindfulness Appears To Intensify The Critic
In early recovery the outer critic unfortunately seems to become nastier and stronger the more we
challenge it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2894 (Number of characters: 103):
We may even think we are counter-productively stirring it up or making it worse by
daring to resist it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2895 (Number of characters: 149):
When mindfulness of the critic seems to strengthen it, we are typically flashing back to how
our parents rebuked our early protests at their attacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2896 (Number of characters: 148):
This is often impossible to remember
because our dysfunctional parents typically kill our protest function before our memory function
comes on line.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2897 (Number of characters: 129):
Nonetheless, fear of parental reprisal is often the unconscious dynamic that scares
us out of challenging our own toxic thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2898 (Number of characters: 133):
This is why survivors in early recovery often need
to invoke the instinct of angry self-protection to empower their thought-stopping.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2899 (Number of characters: 102):
There is another dynamic occurring when critic-work seems to strengthen rather than
weaken the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2900 (Number of characters: 128):
As we become less dissociated, we begin to notice critic processes that were
there all along under the horizon of our awareness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2901 (Number of characters: 96):
Our childhood survival was aided by learning

to dissociate from these painful critic processes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2902 (Number of characters: 82):
Consequently, many of us come into recovery
barely able to even notice the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2903 (Number of characters: 86):
Our recovering depends on us using mindfulness to decrease our habits of dissociation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2904 (Number of characters: 110):
Only then can we see the critic programs that we need to deconstruct, shrink and consciously
disidentify from.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2905 (Number of characters: 121):
This typically involves learning to tolerate the pain that comes from
discovering how pervasive and strong the critic is.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2906 (Number of characters: 110):
This pain is sometimes a hard pill to swallow
because progress in fighting the critic is hard to see at first.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2907 (Number of characters: 109):
And then, even when our shrinking
work is effective, progress usually feels disappointingly slow and gradual.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2908 (Number of characters: 93):
This is especially true
during a flashback, when the critic can seem to be as strong as ever.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2909 (Number of characters: 65):
As stated earlier, the critic grew carcinogenically in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2910 (Number of characters: 84):
It is like a pervasive cancer
that requires many uncomfortable operations to remove.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2911 (Number of characters: 166):
Nonetheless, we can choose to face the
acute pain of critic-shrinking work because we want to end the chronic pain of having the critic
destroy our enjoyment of life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2912 (Number of characters: 30):
It is the fight of a lifetime.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2913 (Number of characters: 430):
Thought Substitution And Correction: Supplanting the Critic
Many of us are still developmentally arrested in our need to orient our psyches towards noticing
what is good, trustworthy and loveable about others and life in general. In working to shrink the
outer critic, thought substitution is the practice of invoking positive thoughts and images of
others to help erode the critic’s intimacy-spoiling habit of picking them apart.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2914 (Number of characters: 152):
One helpful thought substitution exercise is to list five recollections of positive interactions
with a given friend, as well as five of her attributes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2915 (Number of characters: 117):
This same technique works well when we
self-apply it to help us separate from our inner critic’s negative self-image.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2916 (Number of characters: 124):
Toolbox 5, in chapter
16, contains a written exercise to broaden your appreciation of select others who have benefitted
you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2917 (Number of characters: 159):
Since thoughts typically give rise to speech, I also recommend that you practice the “5
positives to 1 negative” guideline when giving feedback to a loved one.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2918 (Number of characters: 115):
John Gottman’s research
has shown that this ratio is characteristic of how intimacy-successful couples communicate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2919 (Number of characters: 122):
This
is also key because the outer critic was spawned in childhood by parental modeling that at least
reversed this ratio.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2920 (Number of characters: 246):
GRIEVING SHORTCIRCUITS THE OUTER CRITIC
The role of grieving in shrinking the outer critic is as crucial as it is with the inner critic. As with
the inner critic, angering at the outer critic helps to silence it, and crying helps to evaporate it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2921 (Number of characters: 70):
We can use the anger of our grief to energize our thought corrections.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2922 (Number of characters: 120):
This helps us to
challenge the critic’s entrenched all-or-none perspective that everyone is as dangerous as our
parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2923 (Number of characters: 138):
Moreover, when our grieving opens into crying, it can release the fear that the outer
critic uses to frighten us out of opening to others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2924 (Number of characters: 91):
Tears can also help us realize that our
loneliness is now causing us much unnecessary pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2925 (Number of characters: 84):
This in turn can motivate us to open to the
possibility of finding safe connections.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2926 (Number of characters: 69):
Defueling The Outer Critic Via Working The Transference

Transference

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2927 (Number of characters: 112):
[AKA projection; AKA displacement] occurs when unprocessed feelings from the
past amplify present time feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2928 (Number of characters: 135):
A key characteristic of outer critic-dominated flashbacks is
that we displace emotional pain from past relationships onto current ones.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2929 (Number of characters: 137):
Transference is the
pipeline from the past that supplies the critic with anger to control, attack or disapprove of
present relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2930 (Number of characters: 193):
As a baby thrives on love, so does the outer critic thrive on anger. Like a parasite, the outer
critic gorges on repressed anger, and then erroneously assigns it to present-day disappointments.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2931 (Number of characters: 165):
The most common transferrential dynamic that I witness occurs when leftover hurt about a
parent gets displaced onto someone we perceive as hurting us in the present.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2932 (Number of characters: 114):
When this occurs,
we respond to them with a magnified anger or anguish that is out of proportion to what they did.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2933 (Number of characters: 123):
Transference can also grossly distort our perceptions, and sometimes we can misperceive a
harmless person as being hurtful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2934 (Number of characters: 154):
Transference can fire up the critic to imagine slights that do not
actually occur. Transference typically runs wild when the outer critic is on a rampage.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2935 (Number of characters: 130):
Just as the inner critic transmutes unreleased anger into self-hate, the outer critic uses it to
control and /or push others away.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2936 (Number of characters: 241):
Unexpressed and unworked through anger about childhood
hurt is a hidden reserve that the critic can always tap into. The anger work of grieving the losses
of childhood is so essential because it breaks the critic’s supply line to this anger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2937 (Number of characters: 134):
Grieving out old unexpressed pain about our poor parenting gradually deconstructs the
process of transferring it unfairly onto others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2938 (Number of characters: 120):
This is crucial because love and intimacy are
murdered when the critic habitually projects old anger out at an intimate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2939 (Number of characters: 129):
Healthy Outer Critic Venting
There are times when venting from the outer critic perspective is healthy, self-protective
behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2940 (Number of characters: 52):
Sometimes the outer critic’s judgments are accurate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2941 (Number of characters: 73):
Sometimes people are acting as
abusively as our parents did in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2942 (Number of characters: 80):
In this vein, there are two healthy applications of outer
critic aggressiveness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2943 (Number of characters: 66):
One is to protect ourselves when someone is actually attacking us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2944 (Number of characters: 61):
The
other is in the work of grieving the losses of childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2945 (Number of characters: 135):
As we shall see in the next chapter,
survivors benefit immeasurably from angrily judging their parents’ atrocious abuse and
negligence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2946 (Number of characters: 155):
Road Rage, Transference And The Outer Critic
Let us take another look at how the outer critic displaces anger from the past onto present-day
relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2947 (Number of characters: 64):
My client Johnny came in for his session boiling with road rage.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2948 (Number of characters: 66):
Something infuriating had
just occurred on his drive to my office.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2949 (Number of characters: 67):
Before his butt hit the couch, he launched away: “That
pompous SOB!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2950 (Number of characters: 24):
People are so obnoxious.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2951 (Number of characters: 56):
Everyone drives like they are the only ones on the road.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2952 (Number of characters: 12):
What a jerk.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2953 (Number of characters: 36):
Driving like he owns the whole road.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2954 (Number of characters: 44):
Not giving a sh*t about anybody but himself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2955 (Number of characters: 42):
Nobody cares about anybody but themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2956 (Number of characters: 7):
Oh god!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2957 (Number of characters: 36):
Don’t let me get started on my wife.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2958 (Number of characters: 49):
I
don’t know why I get out of bed in the morning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2959 (Number of characters: 56):
This jerk must have forgotten what turn signals
are for.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2960 (Number of characters: 80):
I felt like crashing right into that stuck-up bastard and his shiny new Beamer!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2961 (Number of characters: 41):
Johnny radiated anger a full 360 degrees.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2962 (Number of characters: 247):
He hated the driver who had cut him off, all the
other drivers on the road, his wife, his employees, his neighbors, the government, and last - but

thankfully least - his “overcharging therapist” who was always pretending to be “soooo
empathetic.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2963 (Number of characters: 29):
Johnny was a fawn-fight type.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2964 (Number of characters: 27):
Usually he was mostly fawn.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2965 (Number of characters: 99):
In our two years of working
together, I had never seen him so enraged, and I was quite taken aback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2966 (Number of characters: 86):
I was indeed straining to
hold an empathic position, but I knew he was in a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2967 (Number of characters: 78):
I encouraged him to further ventilate by hitting a tennis racket on a cushion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2968 (Number of characters: 94):
[This is a
classic anger-release work technique for externalizing anger in a non-harmful way].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2969 (Number of characters: 44):
Johnny beat
it like his life depended on it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2970 (Number of characters: 63):
When his catharting petered out, I asked him to close his eyes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2971 (Number of characters: 90):
I then suggested that he ask
himself if his feelings of outrage had a trail into the past.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2972 (Number of characters: 36):
After a moment he said: “I’m so mad.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2973 (Number of characters: 51):
I
don’t want to do anything that you say right now.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2974 (Number of characters: 93):
And it’s weird because I know you’re fishing
for my father, but I keep thinking of my mother.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2975 (Number of characters: 20):
She was such a wimp!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2976 (Number of characters: 237):
She’d never drive like
that asshole in the Beamer, and she didn’t rant and rave at me like he did, but you know I just
feel so pissed at her for putting up with him for all those years, and never once standing up for
me or protecting me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2977 (Number of characters: 84):
It’s bad enough I got him for father, but it’s even more unfair that I got her
too”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2978 (Number of characters: 122):
Johnny did another round of venting with the tennis racket: “I thought mothers were
programmed to stick up for their kids!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2979 (Number of characters: 37):
You know, like that mother bear sh*t.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2980 (Number of characters: 51):
It’s so unfair…it’s
so un-f*cken-believably unfair.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2981 (Number of characters: 65):
I’d just like to shake her out of that numb trance she’d go into.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2982 (Number of characters: 41):
Just shake some freaking sense into her!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2983 (Number of characters: 24):
And then the tears came.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2984 (Number of characters: 50):
Shortly after they subsided, the epiphany arrived.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2985 (Number of characters: 18):
It made him
laugh.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2986 (Number of characters: 10):
Genuinely.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2987 (Number of characters: 116):
It was the laughter of relief that we sometimes get when we finally understand
why something is really bothering us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2988 (Number of characters: 157):
He said: “You know this sounds pretty far-fetched and like
that psychobabble I hate, but it’s the goddamn unfairness of life that just pisses me off so much.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2989 (Number of characters: 51):
You know that you-got-the-queen-of-spades bad luck.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2990 (Number of characters: 83):
That bad luck of being the one person in
the crowd who gets crapped on by a pigeon.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2991 (Number of characters: 73):
That cursed luck of getting dealt those assholes from
the parenting deck.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2992 (Number of characters: 25):
It’s so goddamned unfair!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2993 (Number of characters: 47):
Dad and mom’s unfairness was f*cking legendary!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2994 (Number of characters: 84):
“And that jerk on the freeway making a lane change without signaling was unfair too.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2995 (Number of characters: 73):
I
mean if I hadn’t seen him, I could have gotten into a serious accident.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2996 (Number of characters: 49):
But if I’m honest, it wasn’t
really all that bad.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2997 (Number of characters: 86):
I had plenty of time to adjust, and would have been a lousy driver myself if I
hadn’t.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2998 (Number of characters: 43):
“But, I mean it was still dangerous though.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2999 (Number of characters: 49):
But nothing compared to growing up in that
house.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3000 (Number of characters: 48):
Now that was pure, unadulterated danger for you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3001 (Number of characters: 234):
I guess my rage was mostly about how
unfair it was that I had to grow up in that sorry excuse for a home.”
Road rage and the less intense irritations we experience with our fellow drivers are common
forms of outer critic transference.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3002 (Number of characters: 191):
When we become more mindful of our driving frustrations or
other minor everyday annoyances, we can look below the tip of this iceberg for old unexpressed
anger and hurt that it reminds us of.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3003 (Number of characters: 131):
I encourage you to experiment with this next time you are inordinately angry at some driver
for a relatively minor driving mistake.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3004 (Number of characters: 81):
You can try asking yourself: “What is this situation or
feeling reminding me of?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3005 (Number of characters: 569):
In the next chapter, we will explore more deeply the processes of

grieving through the old hurts that we discover when we get to the bottom of our flashbacks. GRIEVING
Grieving is an irreplaceable tool for resolving the overwhelming feelings that arise during
emotional flashbacks. Moreover, grieving is the key process for working through the host of
losses that come from growing up in a Cptsd-inducing family. We grieve the losses of childhood because these losses are like deaths of important parts of
ourselves. Effective grieving brings these parts back to life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3006 (Number of characters: 147):
In this chapter we describe the
healing that is available through the four practices of grieving: angering, crying, verbal
ventilating and feeling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3007 (Number of characters: 189):
If you find that crying or angering is inaccessible, does not help, or makes you feel worse, then
your recovery work my need to focus more on deconstructing and shrinking your inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3008 (Number of characters: 246):
Grieving expands Insight and Understanding
I saw grief drinking a cup of sorrow and called out:
“It tastes sweet doesn’t it?”
“You have caught me”, grief answered,
“And you’ve ruined my business
How can I sell sorrow, when you know its blessing?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3009 (Number of characters: 5):
-RUMI

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3010 (Number of characters: 100):
Insight, as crucially important as it is, is never enough to attain the deeper levels of recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3011 (Number of characters: 139):
No amount of intention or epiphany can bypass a survivor’s need to learn to lovingly care for
himself when he is in an emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3012 (Number of characters: 102):
It is crucial that we respond to ourselves with
kindness when we are feeling scared, sad, mad, or bad.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3013 (Number of characters: 135):
Grieving aids the survivor immeasurably to work through the death-like experience of being

lost and trapped in an emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3014 (Number of characters: 153):
Grieving metabolizes our most painful abandonment
feelings, especially those that give rise to suicidal ideation, and at their worst, active suicidality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3015 (Number of characters: 73):
Recoverees also need to grieve the death of their early attachment needs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3016 (Number of characters: 103):
We must grieve
the awful fact that safety and belonging was scarce or non-existent in our own families.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3017 (Number of characters: 114):
We need
to mourn the myriad heartbreaks of our frustrated attempts to win approval and affection from
our parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3018 (Number of characters: 107):
Grieving also supports recovery from the many painful, deathlike losses caused by
childhood traumatization.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3019 (Number of characters: 115):
Key childhood losses - addressed throughout this book - are all the
crucial developmental arrests that we suffered.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3020 (Number of characters: 161):
The most essential of these are the deaths of our
self-compassion and our self-esteem, as well as our abilities to protect ourselves and fully
express ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3021 (Number of characters: 205):
Grieving The Absence Of Parental Care
As our capacity to grieve evolves, we typically uncover a great deal of unresolved grief about the
deadening absence of the nurturance we needed to develop and thrive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3022 (Number of characters: 89):
Here are the key types of
parental nurturing that all children need in order to flourish.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3023 (Number of characters: 140):
Knowing about these unmet needs
can help you to grieve out the unreleased pain that comes from having grown up without this
type of support.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3024 (Number of characters: 95):
Moreover, this knowledge can guide you to reparent and interact with yourself
more nurturingly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3025 (Number of characters: 21):
1. VERBAL NURTURANCE:

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3026 (Number of characters: 53):

Helping the child balance rest, play, and work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3050 (Number of characters: 334):
My book, The Tao of Fully Feeling, contains extensive guidelines and encouragements for
identifying and grieving the losses of childhood. Sandra Bloom’s article: “The Grief That Dare
Not Speak Its Name, Part II, Dealing with The Ravages of Childhood” also identifies childhood
losses from trauma in a very specific and compelling way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3051 (Number of characters: 34):
[Please see www.sanctuaryweb.com].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3052 (Number of characters: 200):
It is often difficult to become motivated to grieve losses that occurred so long ago. Many of these
losses seem so nebulous that trying to embrace grieving is a bit like trying to embrace dental
work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3053 (Number of characters: 31):
Who wants to go to the dentist?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3054 (Number of characters: 52):
But who doesn’t go once the toothache becomes acute?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3055 (Number of characters: 288):
Soul ache is considerably harder to assign to the losses of childhood, yet those who take the
grieving journey described below come to know unquestionably that the core of their soul ache
and psychological suffering is in the unworked through losses of growing up with abandoning
parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3056 (Number of characters: 151):
These losses have to be grieved until the person really gets how much her caretakers were
not caretakers, and how much her parents were not her allies.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3057 (Number of characters: 377):
She needs to grieve until she stops
blaming herself for their abuse and/or neglect. She needs to grieve until she fully realizes that
their abysmal parenting practices gave her that awful gift that keeps on giving: Cptsd. She needs
to grieve until she understands how her learned habit of automatic self-abandonment is a
reenactment of their abject failure to be there for her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3058 (Number of characters: 104):
Mourning these awful realities empowers our efforts to develop a multidimensional practice
of self-care.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3059 (Number of characters: 143):
As we grieve more effectively, our capacities for self-compassion and self-
protection grow, and our psyche becomes increasingly user friendly.

GRIEVING AMELIORATES FLASHBACKS
“Pain is excess energy crying out for release.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3061 (Number of characters: 240):
– Gerald Heard
Grieving sometimes seems sacramental to me in its ability to move me out of the abandonment
mélange, that extremely painful and upsetting amalgam of fear, shame and depression that is at
the emotional core of most flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3062 (Number of characters: 79):
A survivor can learn to grieve himself out of fear - the death of feeling safe.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3063 (Number of characters: 159):
He can learn to
grieve himself out of shame - the death of feeling worthy. He can learn to grieve himself out of
depression - the death of feeling fully alive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3064 (Number of characters: 99):
With sufficient grieving, the survivor gets that he was innocent and eminently loveable as a
child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3065 (Number of characters: 125):
As he mourns the bad luck of not being born to loving parents, he finds within himself a
fierce, unshakeable self-allegiance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3066 (Number of characters: 120):
He becomes ready, willing and able to be there for himself no
matter what he is experiencing - internally or externally.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3067 (Number of characters: 128):
Griefwork also releases you from the impatience and frustration that can arise when you get re-
stuck in an inner critic attack.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3068 (Number of characters: 117):
This is especially important during those “monster” flashbacks
when the critic can bully you into wanting to give up.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3069 (Number of characters: 161):
At such times, angering and crying at this
terrible intrusion from your past can rescue you from forgetting how far you have come and how
much safer you are now.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3070 (Number of characters: 222):
Inner Critic Hindrances To Grieving

The greatest hindrance to effective grieving is typically the inner critic. When the critic is
especially toxic, grieving may be counterproductive and contraindicated in early recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3071 (Number of characters: 161):
Those
who were repeatedly pathologized and punished for emoting in childhood may experience
grieving as exacerbating their flashbacks rather than relieving them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3072 (Number of characters: 181):
I have worked with numerous survivors whose tears immediately triggered them into toxic
shame. Their own potentially soothing tears elicited terrible self-attacks: “I’m so pathetic!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3073 (Number of characters: 31):
No
wonder nobody can stand me!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3074 (Number of characters: 48):
“God, I’m so unlovable when I snivel like this!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3075 (Number of characters: 70):
“I f*ck up, and
then make myself more of a loser by whining about it!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3076 (Number of characters: 62):
“What good is crying for yourself – it
only makes you weaker!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3077 (Number of characters: 175):
This latter response is particularly ironic, for once grieving is protected from the critic,
nothing can restore a person’s inner strength and coping capacity like a good cry.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3078 (Number of characters: 106):
I have defused
active suicidality on dozens of occasions by simply eliciting the suffering person’s tears.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3079 (Number of characters: 68):
Angering can also immediately trigger the survivor into toxic shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3080 (Number of characters: 79):
This is often true of
instances when there is only an angry thought or fantasy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3081 (Number of characters: 88):
Dysfunctional parents typically reserve
their worst punishments for their child’s anger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3082 (Number of characters: 41):
This then traps the child’s anger inside.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3083 (Number of characters: 405):
Critic management is often the primary work of early stage grief work. This work involves
recognizing and challenging the ways the critic is blocking or shaming the processes of grieving. As disidentification from the critic increases, grieving can then best be initiated with low
intensity verbal ventilation. Over time verbal ventilation can be allowed to gradually increase in
sad and angry intonation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3084 (Number of characters: 197):
Once the critic has been sufficiently diminished and once thought-correction techniques
have made the psyche more user-friendly, a person begins to tap into grief’s sweet relief-granting
potential.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3085 (Number of characters: 186):
He learns to grieve in a way that promotes and enhances compassion for the abandoned
child he was and for the survivor he is today – still struggling in the throes of painful flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3086 (Number of characters: 168):
Defueling The Critic Through Grieving
Fear drives the toxic inner critic. The critic feeds off fear and flashes the survivor back to the
frightening times of childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3087 (Number of characters: 101):
She gets stuck seeing herself only through her parents’
contemptuous, intimidating or rejecting eyes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3088 (Number of characters: 88):
She then imitates them and scornfully mocks
herself as “defective”, “ugly”, “unlovable”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3089 (Number of characters: 98):
She scares herself with endangerment scenarios and
abhors herself for insignificant imperfections.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3090 (Number of characters: 251):
Because fear is a core emotional experience, emotional tools are needed to manage the
fright that runs haywire during a flashback. Healthy angering and crying can short-circuit fear
from morphing into the flashback-triggering cognitions of the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3091 (Number of characters: 144):
I have seen grieving bring
the critic’s devastating programs of drasticizing and catastrophizing to a screeching halt on
thousands of occasions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3092 (Number of characters: 84):
It appears that children are hard-wired to release fear through angering and crying.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3093 (Number of characters: 206):
The
newborn baby, mourning the death of living safely and fully contained inside the mother, utters
the first of many angry cries not only to call for nurturance and attention, but also to release her
fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3094 (Number of characters: 107):
In the dysfunctional family however, the traumatizing parent soon eradicates the child’s
capacity to emote.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3095 (Number of characters: 64):
The child becomes afraid and ashamed of her own tears and anger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3096 (Number of characters: 152):
Tears get
shut off and anger gets trapped inside and is eventually turned against the self as self-attack, self-
hate, self-disgust, and self-rejection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3097 (Number of characters: 67):
Self-hate is the most grievous reenactment of parental
abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3098 (Number of characters: 139):
Over time, anger also becomes fuel for the critic and actually exacerbates fear by creating
an increasingly dangerous internal environment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3099 (Number of characters: 111):
Anything the survivor says, thinks, feels,
imagines or wishes for is subjected to an intimidating inner attack.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3100 (Number of characters: 50):
Here are some common anger-powered critic attacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3101 (Number of characters: 123):
They are presented in the first person
voice, which the critic inevitably acquires: “Why did I ask such a stupid question?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3102 (Number of characters: 51):
“Could I
have had an uglier expression on my face?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3103 (Number of characters: 18):
“Who am I kidding?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3104 (Number of characters: 54):
How could an undeserving
loser like me wish for love?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3105 (Number of characters: 51):
“No wonder I feel like sh*t; I am a piece of sh*t!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3106 (Number of characters: 167):
Recovery is enhanced immeasurably by co-opting this anger from the critic and using it for
the work of distancing from and shrinking the critic, as we shall see below.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3107 (Number of characters: 209):
As you become
proficient at grieving, you will notice that your critic’s volume and intensity ebbs dramatically. In fact, without the aid of effective grieving, progress in critic shrinking can only go so far.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3108 (Number of characters: 157):
THE FOUR PROCESSES OF GRIEVING
Grieving is at its most effective when the survivor can grieve in four ways: angering, crying,
verbal ventilating and feeling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3109 (Number of characters: 2):
1.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3110 (Number of characters: 415):
Angering: Diminishes Fear and Shame
Angering is the grieving technique of aggressively complaining about current or past losses and
injustices. Survivors need to anger - sometimes rage - about the intimidation, humiliation and
neglect that was passed off to them as nurturance in their childhoods. As they become adept at
grieving, they anger out their healthy resentment at their family’s pervasive lack of safety.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3111 (Number of characters: 93):
They
become incensed about the ten thousand betrayals of never being helped in times of need.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3112 (Number of characters: 79):
They
feel rage that there was never anyone to go to for guidance or protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3113 (Number of characters: 124):
They bellow that there
was no one to appeal to for fairness or appreciative recognition of their developmental
achievements.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3114 (Number of characters: 208):
My first book, The Tao of Fully Feeling, Harvesting Forgiveness Out Of Blame, explicates
in great detail a safe process for angering out childhood pain in a way that does not hurt the
survivor or anyone else.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3115 (Number of characters: 89):
In most cases, survivors do not have to directly anger at and blame their
living parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3116 (Number of characters: 86):
The key place to direct it is at your internalized parents - the parents of your past.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3117 (Number of characters: 72):
The most common exception to this occurs when a parent is still abusive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3118 (Number of characters: 65):
This and other
exceptions are explored in depth in my first book.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3119 (Number of characters: 175):
Angering is therapeutic when the survivor rails against childhood trauma, and especially
when he rails against its living continuance in the self-hate processes of the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3120 (Number of characters: 100):
Angrily saying
“No!” or “Shut Up!” to the critic, the deputy of his parents, externalizes his anger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3121 (Number of characters: 140):
It stops him
from turning this anger against himself, and allows him to revive the lost instinct of defending
himself against unjust attack.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3122 (Number of characters: 61):
Additionally, angering rescues the survivor from toxic shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3123 (Number of characters: 81):
It rescues him from blindly

letting his parents’ venomous blame turn into shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3124 (Number of characters: 50):
Angering redirects blame back to where it
belongs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3125 (Number of characters: 101):
It also augments his motivation to keep fighting to establish internal boundaries against
the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3126 (Number of characters: 210):
Angering can be done alone or in the presence of a validating witness, such as a trusted
friend or therapist. Over time the vast majority of angering needs to be done silently in the
privacy of your own psyche.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3127 (Number of characters: 93):
This is the anger-empowered thought-stopping of shielding yourself
from inner critic attacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3128 (Number of characters: 225):
Many survivors are so identified with the critic that it becomes their whole identity. Such
survivors typically need to focus on fighting off the critic until they have established the healthy
ego function of self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3129 (Number of characters: 111):
Angering also serves to rescue a person from the childlike sense of powerlessness that she
is flashing back to.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3130 (Number of characters: 85):
It reminds her that she inhabits an adult body with which she can now defend
herself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3131 (Number of characters: 72):
Through all these functions, angering serves to reduce or antidote fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3132 (Number of characters: 60):
It reawakens and
nurtures the instinct of self-preservation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3133 (Number of characters: 80):
With practice it increasingly builds a sense of both
outer and inner boundaries.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3134 (Number of characters: 56):
These boundaries increasingly move us out of harm’s way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3135 (Number of characters: 113):
They
offer safety from the bullying of others, and safety from the most damaging bully of all – the
inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3136 (Number of characters: 388):
Finally, angering can also empower the myriad thought corrections and substitutions needed
to establish the survivor’s belief in her own essential goodness and in the lovability of
discriminately chosen others. Angering bolsters her for the long-term, gradual process of
wrestling her self-image away from the critic and reeducating the psyche to make it both user-
and intimacy-friendly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3137 (Number of characters: 202):
Angering Helps Deconstruct Repetition Compulsion
Survivors need to resuscitate their instinctual anger about parental maltreatment or they risk
blindly accepting others’ reenactments of these behaviors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3138 (Number of characters: 139):
A meek, visibly fearful client of mine suffered devastating sexual seductions by trusted
male figures on three occasions in her adult life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3139 (Number of characters: 126):
Over time we traced these back to a childhood
betrayal by a trusted uncle, the only seemingly kind caretaker of her childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3140 (Number of characters: 80):
She was
emotionally abandoned by her parents, and he preyed upon her loneliness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3141 (Number of characters: 120):
He gradually took
appropriate physical affection, one increment at a time, into contact that became increasingly
sexual.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3142 (Number of characters: 132):
My client was helpless with her uncle because her ability to say “no” was parentally
extinguished by the time she was in pre-school.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3143 (Number of characters: 75):
The ability to say “no” is the backbone of our
instinct of self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3144 (Number of characters: 62):
Consequently, she was unable to protest his sexual violations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3145 (Number of characters: 137):
On subsequent occasions in her life, a minister, a doctor and then a therapist exploited her
via a reenactment of this original scenario.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3146 (Number of characters: 97):
She was so lost in flashback all three times that she
did not protest their exploitive betrayals.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3147 (Number of characters: 126):
She could only react to the situations later by turning
her anger inward, and blaming and shaming herself for not stopping it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3148 (Number of characters: 96):
Eventually during our work together, she was able to engage in the angering process of
grieving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3149 (Number of characters: 134):
After about six months of my witnessing and validating her anger at her various
perpetrators, she came in one week glowing with pride.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3150 (Number of characters: 152):
She welled with tears of joy and relief as

she described her success in stopping an office predator who was in the early stages of a similar
seduction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3151 (Number of characters: 50):
This was the stage of seemingly friendly touching.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3152 (Number of characters: 128):
But unwanted pats on the back gradually
escalated into mild sexual innuendo, lingering touches on her hand and then her forearm.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3153 (Number of characters: 110):
These
were the first inappropriate advances that she had never been able to protest with her previous
abusers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3154 (Number of characters: 131):
She was thrilled – in awe of herself – that she was able to say, in the presence of another
worker no less: “Please don’t touch me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3155 (Number of characters: 77):
I don’t like it when you touch me, and I don’t want you
to touch me anymore”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3156 (Number of characters: 41):
The seduction was immediately terminated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3157 (Number of characters: 121):
2. Crying: The Penultimate Soothing
In grieving, crying is the yin complementary process to the yang process of angering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3158 (Number of characters: 59):
When we
are hurt, we instinctively feel sad as well as mad.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3159 (Number of characters: 92):
The newborn child, hurt by the loss of the
perfect security of the womb, howls an angry cry.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3160 (Number of characters: 88):
Crying is also an irreplaceable tool for cutting off the critic’s emotional fuel supply.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3161 (Number of characters: 83):
Tears
can release fear before it devolves into frightened and frightening thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3162 (Number of characters: 76):
In fact, crying is
sometimes the only process that will resolve a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3163 (Number of characters: 92):
I have witnessed my own critic wither
into innocuousness hundreds of times after a good cry.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3164 (Number of characters: 136):
On thousands of other occasions, I have
seen my clients dissolve their fear, shame and self-abandonment with the solvent of their tears.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3165 (Number of characters: 141):
I
have also seen them then surface into a healthily angry place, determined to confront a current
unfairness that they now find unacceptable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3166 (Number of characters: 122):
A client who left a year-long therapy to move elsewhere recently wrote to me about an
experience that she had with crying.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3167 (Number of characters: 85):
She was hospitalized with terrible stomach pain and soon
learned that she had cancer.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3168 (Number of characters: 98):
She had wisely cut off contact with a toxic family, but was all alone
in her new living situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3169 (Number of characters: 92):
She was beside herself with fear, and felt like she was on the verge of
a nervous breakdown.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3170 (Number of characters: 97):
She wrote: “I know you think that all that talking you did to me about
crying didn’t get through.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3171 (Number of characters: 145):
So did I in fact, but at the moment I was feeling the most hopeless,
some of your words came back to me, and a rainstorm of tears fell out of me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3172 (Number of characters: 131):
It scared me at
first, but I soon started feeling this amazing sense of relief, and that I would be OK if I let them
operate on me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3173 (Number of characters: 142):
It’s now twelve months since then and many tears later [not to mention a bit of
barking at God] and I seem to be well and truly in the clear.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3174 (Number of characters: 48):
Here is another testimony to the power of tears.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3175 (Number of characters: 123):
It is excerpted from an e-mail of a male
client who wrote to me six months after we finished a year long course of therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3176 (Number of characters: 71):
“I think it’s
the tears..... crying so much of late.....you were right!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3177 (Number of characters: 185):
It’s great; I love it, tears of sadness, tears at
the beauty in the world, tears of grief and loss, and tears of gratitude that my life is finally
becoming manageable and even intimate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3178 (Number of characters: 89):
I’ve cried more in the past couple of months than I
have done the past couple of decades.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3179 (Number of characters: 147):
I am actually opening up to life, it’s become less narrow,
it’s not just pain, shame, guilt.....there’s something else, something quite beautiful.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3180 (Number of characters: 128):
An additional benefit of crying is that unabashed tears stimulate the relaxation response of the
parasympathetic nervous system.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3181 (Number of characters: 104):
This counterbalances the excessive sympathetic nervous
system hyperarousal we experience in a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3182 (Number of characters: 231):
As we learn to grieve effectively, we allow ourselves to mourn about the lack of positive
parental attention in our childhoods. We feel sorrow about the horrible reality that parental
attention was typically negative and dangerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3183 (Number of characters: 123):
As recovering progresses, we also cry for the
child who not appreciated and reflected as special, worthy, and easy to love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3184 (Number of characters: 429):
Crying And Self-Compassion
When we greet our own tears with self-acceptance, crying awakens our develop- mentally
arrested instinct of self-compassion. Once we establish self-compassion through consistent and
repeated practice, it becomes the cornerstone of an increasing sense of self-esteem. When an
attitude of self-compassion becomes habitual, it can instantly antidote the self-abandonment that
so characterizes a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3185 (Number of characters: 122):
Moreover self-compassion creates a foundation from which we can build authentic,
intimacy-enhancing compassion for others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3186 (Number of characters: 147):
The depth of our ability to be there for an intimate
generally depends on the depth of our capacity to practice unwavering allegiance to ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3187 (Number of characters: 133):
Crying And Angering In Concert
Crying and angering are the two key emotional tools for releasing the pain of the abandonment
mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3188 (Number of characters: 56):
Typically we need both processes to attain full release.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3189 (Number of characters: 50):
Crying and angering together differs from whining.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3190 (Number of characters: 355):
Whining is a type of emoting that gives
grieving a bad name. Whining is a delicate subject because many people who complain and/or
cry in a healthy manner are pathologized as “whiners.” Dysfunctional whining however is often
an unhealthy mixture of angering and crying, where either the anger or sadness is repressed but
leaks through in a grating manner.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3191 (Number of characters: 30):
Here are two examples of this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3192 (Number of characters: 194):
When a hurt person only knows how to express anger, his
repressed sadness unconsciously seeps into his anger in a way that makes him sound like a
martyr or someone with delusions of persecution.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3193 (Number of characters: 177):
Because there is no substantial release of his
sadness, no amount of whining brings him relief, and he can angrily whine endlessly in a way
that exhausts his listener’s empathy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3194 (Number of characters: 148):
Similarly when a hurt person is only able to cry, repressed
anger tinges her sadness and makes it sound like irritable and interminable bellyaching.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3195 (Number of characters: 70):
One of
my clients calls this “anger coming through a very small hole.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3196 (Number of characters: 270):
Many of us suffer from a socialization process that relegates angering to men and crying to
women. From an early age boys are shamed for crying while girls are treated similarly for
angering. Hence boys become men who can only vent their emotional pain through angering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3197 (Number of characters: 86):
Sadness then must morph into an irritable mood, aggravated whining or angry catharsis.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3198 (Number of characters: 160):
Similarly, some women unconsciously try to squeeze their anger out by whining or crying in a
way that devolves into feeling stuck in helplessness and self-pity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3199 (Number of characters: 71):
Many men also rely on anger to carry all of their emotional expression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3200 (Number of characters: 59):
They get mad when
they are scared, humiliated or feel down.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3201 (Number of characters: 70):
Many women, on the other hand, can only try to cry out
these feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3202 (Number of characters: 52):
This typically results in a very incomplete release.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3203 (Number of characters: 39):
The full motion of emotion is
arrested.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3204 (Number of characters: 76):
Half of the normal emotional release process is then stymied in each gender.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3205 (Number of characters: 152):
Without complete emoting of his hurt, a survivor can become stuck in moodiness. His
unexpressed emotion deteriorates into a stagnant and lingering mood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3206 (Number of characters: 121):
This moodiness can range

from festering resentment to a shame-tainted self-pity that is anything but self-compassionate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3207 (Number of characters: 122):
Blocked anger can degenerate into bitter sullenness, and blocked sadness can deteriorate into
melancholic self-indulgence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3208 (Number of characters: 141):
How this contrasts with the healthy grieving of my six-year old son, who has to periodically
grieve the loss of his narcissistic entitlement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3209 (Number of characters: 74):
Less and less does he get to be what Freud called:
“His majesty the baby”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3210 (Number of characters: 115):
As his previously apt entitlement lessens, he mildly bawls at new rules that are age-
appropriate for him to learn.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3211 (Number of characters: 92):
Bawling is the evolution of the baby’s angry cry, and it releases
pain through angry crying.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3212 (Number of characters: 127):
He howled a bit this afternoon about the “unfairness” of having to do
his homework after school before he could play some more.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3213 (Number of characters: 128):
As we climbed the 37 stairs to our home, he punctuated his crying with a flurry of angry
condemnations: “I don’t like you daddy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3214 (Number of characters: 16):
You’re not fair.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3215 (Number of characters: 33):
I’m not going to be your friend”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3216 (Number of characters: 182):
I am
grateful for this healthy grieving, and still somewhat amazed that I can so calmly “hold” it as I
help him metabolize this latest loss of early childhood narcissistic privilege.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3217 (Number of characters: 118):
By the time we get to the top of the stairs he opens the door and genuinely peals out a
guileless laugh: “Daddy, look!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3218 (Number of characters: 27):
Picachu fell off the table.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3219 (Number of characters: 213):
Daddy can we play Pokémon after I
practice writing my letters?”
Grieving has almost instantly delivered him from painful loss into eager apprehension of
what is fun about life and what there is to look forward to.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3220 (Number of characters: 150):
How frequently, I see my clients
reemerge into remembering their real, present-day resourcefulness once they have grieved
through a painful flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3221 (Number of characters: 158):
When we can both anger and cry while re-experiencing our early abandonment in a
flashback, we can obtain a more complete release from the abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3222 (Number of characters: 125):
Each survivor
does well to assess whether his angering or crying is blocked or stultified, and to then work at
recovering it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3223 (Number of characters: 111):
There are of course numerous men and women who are reverse examples of the gender
polarization mentioned above.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3224 (Number of characters: 80):
Moreover, there are many survivors in whom both angering and
crying are blocked.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3225 (Number of characters: 134):
They also benefit inordinately from rescuing the healing balm of both anger
and tears from the stultifying prohibitions of the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3226 (Number of characters: 83):
If you are unable cry or feel angry, focusing on your breath may help you to emote.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3227 (Number of characters: 128):
This is
especially true if you attend to the sensations in your abdominal region as it expands and
contracts during respiration.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3228 (Number of characters: 154):
Deep, slow and rhythmic breathing stretches and expands various
visceral muscles and internal organs in ways that sometimes bring feelings into awareness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3229 (Number of characters: 130):
If this does not help, Holotropic Rebirthing and Reichian therapy employ special breathing
techniques to help free stuck emotions.

- Old Chinese saying

Verbal ventilation is the third process of grieving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3234 (Number of characters: 55):
It is the penultimate resolver of
emotional flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3235 (Number of characters: 98):
Verbal ventilation is speaking or writing in a manner that airs out and
releases painful feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3236 (Number of characters: 142):
When we let our words spring from what we feel, language is imbued
with emotion, and pain can be released through what we say, think or write.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3237 (Number of characters: 231):
As our grieving
proficiency increases, we can verbally ventilate about our losses, using shame-dissolving
language to tell the story of how we were unfairly deprived of our birthright to be welcomed into
a family that cherished us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3238 (Number of characters: 179):
My favorite technique to enhance verbal ventilation is to encourage the survivor to talk in
an uncensored manner about whatever comes to his mind while he focuses on his feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3239 (Number of characters: 112):
If his
feelings are not in awareness, focusing on bodily sensations can provide rich grist for verbally
venting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3240 (Number of characters: 260):
Verbal Ventilation is therapeutic to the degree that a person’s words are colored by and
descriptive of the anger, sadness, fear, shame and/or depression she feels. Ventilation that is
liberally punctuated with actual crying or angering is especially powerful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3241 (Number of characters: 134):
Theoretical Neuroscience Of Verbal Ventilation
Verbal ventilation is a tool that can remediate brain changes that are caused by Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3242 (Number of characters: 329):
Susan
Vaughan’s MRI research demonstrates that emotional flashbacks over-activate the emotionally
oriented right-brain and under-activate the thinking-oriented left-brain. With this hemispheric
polarization, there is an overwhelming reemergence of childhood pain that is emotionally
remembered by the memory-oriented right-brain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3243 (Number of characters: 304):
At the same time, the survivor loses access to
the higher cognitive functions of her left-brain. This temporary loss of cognitive perspective
explains why it is so hard for a survivor to realize that she is only flashing back, and not really
lost in the danger, helplessness and hopelessness of the past.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3244 (Number of characters: 144):
Verbal ventilation, at its most potent, is the therapeutic process of bringing left-brain
cognition to intense right-brain emotional activation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3245 (Number of characters: 149):
It fosters the recoveree’s ability to put
words to feelings, and ultimately to accurately interpret and communicate about his various
feeling states.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3246 (Number of characters: 187):
When this process is repeated sufficiently, new neural pathways grow that allow
the left- and right-brain to work together so that the person can actually think and feel at the
same time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3247 (Number of characters: 90):
The corpus callosum is the part of the brain that connects the left and right hemispheres.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3248 (Number of characters: 75):
Research shows that the corpus callosum is smaller in some Cptsd survivors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3249 (Number of characters: 117):
Further research
shows that the brain can generate new neurons and new neuronal connections to remedy this
situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3250 (Number of characters: 135):
Thinking And Feeling Simultaneously
When a survivor becomes proficient at verbal ventilation, she heals a crucial developmental
arrest.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3251 (Number of characters: 118):
She learns to think about feeling states in a way that creates healthy, helpful and
appropriate responses to feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3252 (Number of characters: 89):
These responses are characteristically respectful to herself and
to whomever she is with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3253 (Number of characters: 111):
In his book, Emotional Intelligence, Daniel Goleman writes that this is
a core trait of emotional intelligence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3254 (Number of characters: 238):
With continued practice, verbal ventilation coordinates the left and right hemispheres of the

brain so that whenever the right-brain is hyper-activated in flashback, the left-brain is also fully
engaged [this also can be seen in an MRI].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3255 (Number of characters: 138):
With the left-brain back on line, the survivor can
remember to use the flashback management steps to successfully help manage a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3256 (Number of characters: 113):
As with angering and crying, verbal ventilation is only effective when it is liberated from
the critic’s control.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3257 (Number of characters: 86):
In early recovery, verbal ventilation can easily shift into verbal self-
flagellation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3258 (Number of characters: 116):
Verbally ventilating from the self-attacking or drasticizing perspective of the critic is
rarely effective grieving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3259 (Number of characters: 129):
Instead it typically triggers or intensifies flashbacks, which in turn
frequently generates self- and intimacy-injuring behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3260 (Number of characters: 134):
Many survivors in early recovery are unable to notice their unconscious shifts into over-
identifying with the critic’s point of view.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3261 (Number of characters: 149):
When this is the case, they usually need the help of a
therapist or sufficiently recovered intimate to help them recognize and neutralize the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3262 (Number of characters: 68):
Verbal Ventilation is an especially transformative grieving process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3263 (Number of characters: 196):
It not only promotes the
same type of fear-release and shame-dissolution as angering and crying, but also helps to expose
the manifold guises of the critic’s self-attack and fear-arousal programs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3264 (Number of characters: 136):
Verbal ventilation also
helps us to identify and communicate about needs that have long been unmet because of our
childhood abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3265 (Number of characters: 118):
Verbally Ventilating Alone
Verbally venting alone, where no one else can hear you, is a helpful therapeutic technique.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3266 (Number of characters: 83):
Untraumatized children do it frequently in their play, much to their great benefit.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3267 (Number of characters: 73):
If your room is
not private, you can drive your car to somewhere that is.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3268 (Number of characters: 88):
Typically it takes considerable silencing of the critic to regain this therapeutic tool.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3269 (Number of characters: 127):
This
tool is so powerful and restorative that it is worth many skirmishes with the critic to reclaim it for
your Cptsd toolbox.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3270 (Number of characters: 102):
One of my clients kept an 18” length of rubber hose and a phone book on the passenger seat
of her car.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3271 (Number of characters: 180):
During the year that she was doing the lion’s share of her anger work, she would hit
the hose loudly on the phonebook whenever her brainwashing, abusive father came up in her
mind.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3272 (Number of characters: 141):
She would of course pull over for this, and found over time that she could do it
inconspicuously in places with surprisingly limited privacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3273 (Number of characters: 71):
It was remarkable to me how much
critic-shrinking she did in that year.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3274 (Number of characters: 174):
Dissociation Deadens Verbal Ventilation
It is important to differentiate verbal ventilation from dissociative flights of fantasy and
obsessive bouts of unproductive worrying.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3275 (Number of characters: 225):
Dissociation is a defense that children develop to
distract and protect themselves from the overwhelming pain of their abandonment. As
unsupported children, we have to dissociate because we are not able to effectively grieve.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3276 (Number of characters: 87):
We
have to protect ourselves by not allowing the full brunt of our pain into awareness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3277 (Number of characters: 232):
As we saw in chapter 6, there are two common types of dissociation: right-brain
dissociation and left-brain dissociation. Right-brain dissociation can be seen as classical dissociation and as the defense most
common to freeze types.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3278 (Number of characters: 102):
It is the right-brain process of numbing out against intense feeling or
incessant inner critic attack.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3279 (Number of characters: 52):
Dissociation is once again a process of distraction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3280 (Number of characters: 96):
Survivors

commonly experience it as getting lost in fantasy, fogginess, TV, tiredness or sleep.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3281 (Number of characters: 98):
Verbally reporting from a place of self-distraction is in fact the opposite of verbal
ventilation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3282 (Number of characters: 144):
Getting lost in daydream-like descriptions of improbable salvation fantasies is a
common way that clients avoid their pain in a therapy session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3283 (Number of characters: 133):
Another common example is
recounting long elaborate dreams that are devoid of emotional content or serious attempts at
introspection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3284 (Number of characters: 148):
Early in my career, I worked briefly with a freeze-fight type client who was stuck in an
avoidance process of endlessly monologing about her dreams.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3285 (Number of characters: 52):
Dina recalled them in lifeless,
excruciating detail.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3286 (Number of characters: 92):
In fact, her deadened delivery was emblematic of the way she talked about
almost everything.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3287 (Number of characters: 130):
Dina was an intern-therapist who locked up her vulnerability with a belief that dream work
was the piece de resistance of therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3288 (Number of characters: 131):
My attempts to guide her into exploring her deeper
underlying experience were routinely met with the hackles of her fight response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3289 (Number of characters: 192):
I was
unfortunately not experienced enough at the time to help her see that this was a dissociative
defense that she had constructed as a child to protect herself from a very intrusive mother.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3290 (Number of characters: 167):
Sadly,
she left therapy disgruntled and still trapped in the isolation that was born of alienating others
with her distant, abstract and non-interactive dissertations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3291 (Number of characters: 65):
Left-Brain Dissociation
Left-brain dissociation is obsessiveness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3292 (Number of characters: 164):
Commonly, this ranges in severity from dwelling on a
singular worry… to repetitively cycling through a list of worries… to panicky drasticizing and
catastrophizing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3293 (Number of characters: 180):
This type of dissociation from internal pain strands the survivor in unhelpful
ruminations about issues that are unrelated or minimally related to the true nature of her
suffering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3294 (Number of characters: 27):
This is an example of this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3295 (Number of characters: 118):
Your friend complains incessantly about the bad weather or the
unfairness of people who do not use their turn signals.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3296 (Number of characters: 143):
He cannot stop grumbling because no
amount of complaining about the wrong thing releases the real pain that is driving his obsessive
grievance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3297 (Number of characters: 219):
If he were able to look deeper at what is really troubling him, he might learn that his
wife’s constructive feedback is continuously flashing him back into the fear and shame he felt
when his mother verbally abused him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3298 (Number of characters: 64):
Left-brain dissociation can also be a process of trivialization.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3299 (Number of characters: 128):
This occurs when the survivor
over-focuses on superficial external concerns to distract himself from upsetting inner experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3300 (Number of characters: 117):
Becoming overly preoccupied with sports statistics or the lives of Hollywood celebrities are
common examples of this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3301 (Number of characters: 108):
This is not, of course, to say that such interests are not worthwhile
when they are pursued with moderation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3302 (Number of characters: 73):
Finally, left-brain dissociation can also be seen in intellectualization.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3303 (Number of characters: 93):
This is what the
novelist, Ian McEwan, called the “high-walled fortress of focused thinking”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3304 (Number of characters: 135):
Some survivors
over-rely on reasoning and lofty dialogue to protect themselves from the potentially messy and
painful world of feeling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3305 (Number of characters: 121):
Even the highest levels of creative thinking can deteriorate into an
obsessive defense when they are excessively engaged.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3306 (Number of characters: 153):
Verbal Ventilation Heals Abandonment

When we share what is emotionally important to us, we learn to connect with others in a
meaningful and healing way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3307 (Number of characters: 105):
This applies to sharing concerns that excite and please us, as well
as those that frighten or depress us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3308 (Number of characters: 137):
Perhaps there was no more detrimental consequence of our
childhood abandonment than being forced to habitually hide our authentic selves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3309 (Number of characters: 123):
Many of us
come out of childhood believing that what we have to say is as uninteresting to others as it was
to our parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3310 (Number of characters: 51):
We must repudiate this damaging legacy of the past.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3311 (Number of characters: 59):
Verbal ventilation is the key way that
people make friends.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3312 (Number of characters: 144):
It parallels the way tender touch, soothing voice, and welcoming facial
expressions helps infants and toddlers establish bonding and attachment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3313 (Number of characters: 164):
When we practice the
emotionally based communication of verbal ventilation in a safe environment, we repair the
damage of not having had this need met in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3314 (Number of characters: 145):
This in turn opens up the possibility of
finally attaining the verbal-emotional intimacy that is an essential lifelong need for all human
beings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3315 (Number of characters: 80):
Committing to this type of practice typically requires courage and perseverance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3316 (Number of characters: 128):
Authentic
sharing can be triggering, and sometimes flashes the survivor back to being punished or rejected
for being vulnerable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3317 (Number of characters: 127):
Therapy, individual or group, can help greatly to overcome and work
through these obstacles to vitalizing your self-expression.

Verbal Ventilation And Intimacy
Reciprocal verbal ventilation is the highway to intimacy in adult relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3319 (Number of characters: 113):
Sufficient practice
with a safe enough other brings genuine experiences of comforting and restorative connection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3320 (Number of characters: 117):
For me and many of my clients, such experiences are more alleviating of loneliness than we had
ever thought possible.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3321 (Number of characters: 184):
Nowhere is this truer than with mutual commiseration. Mutual commiseration is the process
in which two intimates are reciprocally sympathetic to each other’s troubles and difficulties.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3322 (Number of characters: 74):
It is
the deepest most intimate channel to intimacy – profounder than sex.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3323 (Number of characters: 128):
Mutual commiseration also
typically promotes a spontaneous opening into many levels of light-hearted and spontaneous
connecting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3324 (Number of characters: 166):
As deep and meaningful connection with another becomes more available and frequent, the
survivor increasingly experiences the shrinking of his abandonment depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3325 (Number of characters: 110):
I must reiterate here that some popular bodywork approaches to trauma belittle the
usefulness of talk therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3326 (Number of characters: 125):
While somatic work is a vital tool of recovery, it alone cannot shrink
your toxic critic or resuscitate your self-expression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3327 (Number of characters: 107):
Cognitive work, especially that which is
empowered by verbal ventilation, is fundamental to Cptsd recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3328 (Number of characters: 112):
With that said, we will move on to Feeling, the fourth grieving process – a process that is a
type of body work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3329 (Number of characters: 154):
Feeling is a way of focusing on somatic experience that enables us to reclaim
our ability to experience full, relaxed and vital inhabitancy of our bodies.

chunk 3331 (Number of characters: 300):
Feeling: Passively Working Through Grief

“Feeling is the antithesis of pain…the more pain one feels, the less pain one suffers”
– Arthur Janov
Ongoing engagement in the active grieving processes of angering, crying and verbal ventilation
can help us to discover the fourth grieving process: Feeling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3332 (Number of characters: 228):
Feeling is a subtler, passive process than emoting. It is best illustrated by contrasting the
concepts of emoting and feeling. Emoting is when we cry, anger out, or verbally ventilate the
energy of an inner emotional experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3333 (Number of characters: 264):
Feeling, on the other hand, is the inactive process of
staying present to internal emotional experience without reacting. In recovery then, feeling is
surrendering to our internal experiences of pain without judging or resisting them, and without
emoting them out.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3334 (Number of characters: 60):
Feeling is a kinesthetic rather than a cognitive experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3335 (Number of characters: 129):
It is the process of shifting the
focus of your awareness off of thinking and onto your affects, energetic states and sensations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3336 (Number of characters: 77):
It
is the proverbial “getting out of your head” and “getting into your body.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3337 (Number of characters: 387):
As a grieving process, feeling involves consciously reversing the learned survival
mechanism of clamping down on pain to banish it from awareness. Feeling “occurs” when we direct our attention to an emotionally or physically painful state,
and surrender to this experience without resistance. When we relax acceptingly into our pain, we
can learn to gently absorb it into our experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3338 (Number of characters: 136):
Feeling then functions as if our awareness is a
solvent that dissolves and metabolizes the affect, energy and sensation of our emotions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3339 (Number of characters: 182):
Feeling Can Heal Digestive Problems
The practice of feeling is also similar to healthy food digestion whereby a relaxed digestive tract
allows us to effectively assimilate nutrients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3340 (Number of characters: 128):
If, however, we suppress or repress our feelings, our
bodies typically armor and tighten, especially along the alimentary canal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3341 (Number of characters: 116):
I believe digestive tract-tightening can create the types of digestive problems that frequently
co-occur with Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3342 (Number of characters: 222):
Diarrhea, for instance, is sometimes an emotionally-caused, physical
response to intense danger. When this occurs, fear triggers the sympathetic nervous system into
further triggering an immediate evacuation of the bowels.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3343 (Number of characters: 29):
Nausea can operate similarly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3344 (Number of characters: 152):
Constipation, on the other hand, is sometimes a tightening in the alimentary canal that hampers
the peristaltic motion necessary for healthy evacuation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3345 (Number of characters: 372):
The Emotional-Physical Connection
There is often a close relationship between emotion and physical sensation. Physical sensations
in the body often co-occur with feelings. Moreover, sensations of tightness and tension can
develop as a defense against feelings. As unexpressed feelings accumulate, a greater degree of
muscular tension is necessary to keep them under wraps.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3346 (Number of characters: 109):
A child who is repeatedly punished for emoting learns to be afraid of inner emotional
experience and tightens

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3347 (Number of characters: 164):
[armors] the musculature of her body in an effort to hold feelings in and
to banish them from awareness. Holding your breath is a further manifestation of armoring.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3348 (Number of characters: 134):
It is an especially common way
of keeping feelings at bay, as breathing naturally brings your awareness down to the level of

feeling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3349 (Number of characters: 191):
As my client, Kylie, free associated on the feelings of a particularly intense flashback, she
painfully recalled the traumas she underwent trying to avoid her mother’s punishments for
crying.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3350 (Number of characters: 158):
Her worst memory was of the day in the supermarket, when her mother’s scolding rained
down upon her as she tried to suppress her rapidly mounting urge to cry.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3351 (Number of characters: 98):
Knowing the worst
punishment would ensue if she cried, she held her breath to hold back the tears.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3352 (Number of characters: 96):
She held it so
long that she fainted from lack of oxygen and cracked her head open on the floor.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3353 (Number of characters: 103):
Her mother,
mortified by what she saw as public humiliation, beat her black and blue when she got home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3354 (Number of characters: 87):
It took us two years of trust-building work to bring this incident back into awareness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3355 (Number of characters: 154):
She
then cried her first tears since when it happened, three decades earlier. These were also the first
tears she could ever remember that brought relief.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3356 (Number of characters: 145):
The technique of focusing your awareness on physical sensations in your body can help you
to become more proficient at the practice of “feeling”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3357 (Number of characters: 164):
With enough practice, paying attention to
tightness in your face, throat, heart or belly area brings feelings into awareness, where they can
simply be felt through.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3358 (Number of characters: 154):
However, in your early experiences of focusing on sensations, feelings
may come up so strongly that you will benefit from allowing yourself to emote them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3359 (Number of characters: 203):
Balancing Feeling And Emoting
When we become more mindful of the subtle sensations of feelings, the passive grieving process
of feeling through them complements the active processes of grieving them out.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3360 (Number of characters: 129):
We are typically
in advanced recovery when we can both emote out and feel through our anger, sadness, fear,
shame and depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3361 (Number of characters: 223):
Furthermore, feeling also helps us to bring emotions into awareness that need to be grieved
out through active, cathartic emoting. Thus, grieving is especially profound when we can fluidly
shift between feeling and emoting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3362 (Number of characters: 80):
Sometimes we will only need to fully feel and accept the
sensations of our pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3363 (Number of characters: 147):
Other times we will want to verbally ventilate about our pain with
someone who gives us full permission to color our words with angering and tears.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3364 (Number of characters: 176):
Learning To Feel
As a survivor becomes more adept at angering and crying, fear of his feelings will decrease, and
opportunities to learn to simply feel will present themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3365 (Number of characters: 262):
He can engage these opportunities
by passively attuning to the more subtle sensations of his anger and sadness. Over time this practice will build his ability to stay passively present to the sensations of his
deeper feelings – to his fear, shame and depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3366 (Number of characters: 145):
But in early stages, this awareness will often
morph into the need to actively emote them out – to grieve himself out of the abandonment
mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3367 (Number of characters: 132):
Eventually, however, his abandonment mélange feelings will also be digested and
worked through purely with the solvent of awareness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3368 (Number of characters: 154):
This also applies to anxiety which is often
fear just below the level of awareness. With sufficient practice, anxiety can often be felt through
passively.

An Exercise In Feeling

Here is an exercise to help you enhance your ability to feel and grieve through pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3371 (Number of characters: 100):
Visualize
yourself as time-traveling back to a place in the past when you felt especially abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3372 (Number of characters: 407):
See
your adult self taking your abandoned child onto your lap and comforting her in various painful
emotional states or situations. You can comfort her/him verbally: “I feel such sorrow that you
were so abandoned and that you felt so alone so much of the time. I love you even more when
you are stuck in this abandonment pain – especially because you had to endure it for so long with
no one to comfort you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3373 (Number of characters: 36):
That shouldn’t have happened to you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3374 (Number of characters: 33):
It shouldn’t happen to any child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3375 (Number of characters: 28):
Let me comfort and hold you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3376 (Number of characters: 38):
You don’t have to rush to get over it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3377 (Number of characters: 66):
It is not your fault. You
didn’t cause it and you’re not to blame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3378 (Number of characters: 30):
You don’t have to do anything.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3379 (Number of characters: 21):
Just let me hold you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3380 (Number of characters: 15):
Take your time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3381 (Number of characters: 53):
I love you always and care about you no matter what.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3382 (Number of characters: 129):
I highly recommend practicing this even if it feels inauthentic, and even if it requires a great
deal of fending off your critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3383 (Number of characters: 129):
Keep practicing and eventually, you will have a genuine
experience of feeling self-compassion for the traumatized child you were.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3384 (Number of characters: 81):
When that occurs, you
will know that your recovery work had reached a deep level.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3385 (Number of characters: 240):
Techniques To Invite And Enhance Grieving
Tears were hard to come by after my first breakthrough cry in early adulthood. I would often
long for the incredible relief I felt on that occasion, but unlike angering, I could not force my
crying.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3386 (Number of characters: 57):
I have come to learn that this is typical of many people.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3387 (Number of characters: 118):
My friend Malcolm, suffering the
same frustration, wanted to cry so badly, that he squeezed lemon juice into his eyes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3388 (Number of characters: 86):
He was able
to laugh about it later, but solemnly warned me to never try such a thing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3389 (Number of characters: 105):
This is a list that evolved out of our ongoing discussions about how to coax out the tears of
a good cry.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3390 (Number of characters: 126):
As with all the advice in this book, please feel free to use only the ones that seem to
fit, and in whatever order seems best.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3391 (Number of characters: 89):
Moreover, different combinations may enhance either
crying or angering, or both together.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3392 (Number of characters: 128):
Finally, sometimes nothing works, but I encourage you to
try techniques that intuitively seem like they may work more than once.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3393 (Number of characters: 62):
1. Find a safe and comfortable place where you won’t be heard.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3394 (Number of characters: 83):
2. Close your eyes and remember a time when you felt compassionate towards someone.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3395 (Number of characters: 107):
This can be from real life, or from reading a book or a poem, or from watching a movie
or moving news item.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3396 (Number of characters: 123):
3. Invoke self-compassion via the memory of someone who was kind to you, or imagine
someone you think would be kind to you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3397 (Number of characters: 23):
I would be kind to you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3398 (Number of characters: 110):
4. Verbally ventilate about what is bothering you in a journal or aloud to a real or
imagined friend or to me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3399 (Number of characters: 2):
5.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3400 (Number of characters: 51):
Imagine yourself being comforted by a Higher Power.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3401 (Number of characters: 79):
See yourself in the lap of a kind
higher power or actual person who seems kind.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3402 (Number of characters: 53):
[Santa Claus once worked well for one
of my clients].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3403 (Number of characters: 211):
6. Remember a time when you felt better from crying or angering, or seeing someone else
cry in real life or in a movie. 7. Remember a time when being angry, or when someone else being angry, saved you
from harm.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3404 (Number of characters: 2):
8.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3405 (Number of characters: 64):
Imagine your anger forming a protective fiery shield around you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3406 (Number of characters: 2):
9.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3407 (Number of characters: 85):
Imagine your tears or anger carrying any fear, shame or depression up and out of you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3408 (Number of characters: 3):
10.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3409 (Number of characters: 49):
Imagine holding your inner child compassionately.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3410 (Number of characters: 85):
Tell the child it’s normal and okay
to feel sad or mad about feeling bad or hurt.
11.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3411 (Number of characters: 64):
Tell the child you’ll protect him/her from being criticized.
12.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3412 (Number of characters: 33):
Breathe deeply, fully and slowly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3413 (Number of characters: 3):
13.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3414 (Number of characters: 38):
Put on some moving or evocative music.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3415 (Number of characters: 3):
14.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3416 (Number of characters: 35):
Watch a movie that is poignant.
15.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3417 (Number of characters: 53):
Watch a movie that portrays “enviable” anger release.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3418 (Number of characters: 229):
An elaborating note on technique #15: Several clients told me that the scene in the 1976 movie
Network where the main character yells out a window: “We’re not taking it anymore”, helped
them to bring up and ventilate their anger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3419 (Number of characters: 255):
Finally, if reading this book does not begin to release the critic’s stranglehold on your ability to
grieve, please consider working with a therapist or support group to help you work through the
shame that the critic uses to spoil your ability to grieve.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3420 (Number of characters: 488):
THE MAP: MANAGING THE ABANDONMENT DEPRESSION
Cptsd burdens us with a hair-trigger susceptibility to painful emotional flashbacks. Flashbacks,
as we have seen, are layers of defensive reactions to the abandonment depression. These
reactions include physical, behavioral, cognitive, emotional and relational responses to the
reemerging sense of danger and despair that plagued our childhood abandonment. This chapter presents a map of these layered, defensive reactions to abandonment pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3421 (Number of characters: 83):
This
map shows you which reactions are most important to work on at any given time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3422 (Number of characters: 83):
It includes a
strategy for reducing harmful reactions that are no longer necessary.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3423 (Number of characters: 219):
This strategy involves self-
compassionately soothing yourself when you are trapped in fear and/or depression, so that you
do not launch into intensified fear, toxic shame, critic attacks, or self-damaging 4F reactions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3424 (Number of characters: 119):
Cycles Of Reactivity
This section presents a verbal diagram of the layering of our reactions in an emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3425 (Number of characters: 218):
Experiences of depression and abandonment trigger us into fear and shame, which then activates
panicky inner critic thinking, which in turn launches us into an adrenalized fight, flight, freeze or
fawn trauma response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3426 (Number of characters: 55):
This is how that reactivity takes place in a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3427 (Number of characters: 38):
A survivor wakes up feeling
depressed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3428 (Number of characters: 143):
Because childhood experience has conditioned her to believe that she is unworthy and
unacceptable in this state, she feels anxious and ashamed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3429 (Number of characters: 108):
This in turn activates her inner critic to
scare her with perfectionistic rants: “No wonder no one likes me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3430 (Number of characters: 199):
I’ve got to get my lazy,
worthless ass out of bed or I’ll end up like that homeless, bag lady in the park!”
Retraumatized by her own inner voice, she then launches into her most habitual 4F
behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3431 (Number of characters: 306):
She either lashes out domineeringly at the nearest person [Fight] – or she launches
busily into anxious productivity [Flight] – or she flips on the TV and foggily tunes out or dozes
off again [Freeze] – or she self-abandoningly redirects her attention to figuring out how to fix a

friend’s problem [Fawn].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3432 (Number of characters: 100):
All this typically happens so quickly that we do not notice the fear and shame, or the inner
critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3433 (Number of characters: 130):
The first thing that we usually begin to notice in early recovery is that suddenly we are
engaged in our most typical 4F response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3434 (Number of characters: 53):
As recovery progresses we become aware of the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3435 (Number of characters: 80):
Eventually this promotes mindfulness of the fear and shame that fuel the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3436 (Number of characters: 84):
And finally in
later recovery, we become aware of the abandonment depression itself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3437 (Number of characters: 61):
Unfortunately this dynamic also commonly operates in reverse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3438 (Number of characters: 118):
This can occur in early recovery
when you suddenly notice that you have slipped back into a dysfunctional 4F behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3439 (Number of characters: 97):
This then
triggers you into new self-attacking criticism, which then amps up your fear and shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3440 (Number of characters: 203):
This in
turn increases your abandonment depression as the process of self-abandonment runs riot. Desperate to escape the deathlike feelings of the abandonment depression, the initial cycle
revs up again.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3441 (Number of characters: 131):
Depression creates fear and shame which fuels venomous critic attacks and
launches you into fighting, fleeing, freezing or fawning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3442 (Number of characters: 120):
Survivors can careen back and forth through these layered reactions creating perpetual
motion cycles of internal trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3443 (Number of characters: 128):
I believe this process also accounts for the spiraling down feeling that many survivors
report having during intense flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3444 (Number of characters: 175):
This is a diagram of these dynamics:
ABANDONMENT DEPRESSION 
 FEAR & SHAME 
 INNER
CRITIC 
 4Fs
Let us look at a case example of how triggering works in the reverse direction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3445 (Number of characters: 93):
My mega-
perfectionistic, flight-type client, Mario, came into our session five minutes late.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3446 (Number of characters: 63):
It was the first
time he had been late in two years of therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3447 (Number of characters: 103):
Mario was in full-fledged flight, sweating from racing up the hill from his parking space a
block away.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3448 (Number of characters: 52):
He told me he just could not sit on the couch today.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3449 (Number of characters: 48):
Could he please just pace in
front of the couch.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3450 (Number of characters: 19):
“I hate being late.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3451 (Number of characters: 82):
I won’t tell you - please don’t ask – just how fast I was
driving on the freeway!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3452 (Number of characters: 195):
Mario compulsively paced, but this driven-ness was nothing compared to the speed of his
obsessing, as he rattled off many versions of most of the inner critic attack programs listed in
chapter 9.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3453 (Number of characters: 78):
To him, his being late was merely the tip of the iceberg of his defectiveness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3454 (Number of characters: 134):
As his rant
against himself amped up, he increasingly scared himself with his own words, and shamed
himself with his parents’ disgust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3455 (Number of characters: 132):
Finally, seemingly exhausted, Mario collapsed on the couch, and launched into the first
suicidal ideation I had ever heard from him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3456 (Number of characters: 192):
He had just landed in the pit of the abandonment
mélange [depression encrusted with fear and shame] and was sinking to the bottom into a
despairing depression of helplessness and hopelessness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3457 (Number of characters: 88):
This was the real helplessness and
hopelessness that had so characterized his childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3458 (Number of characters: 100):
Fortunately, I had been diligently planting seeds about his need to grieve over the last two

years.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3459 (Number of characters: 117):
For the first time since early childhood, the tears came, and it was the most moving
monsoon I had witnessed in ages.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3460 (Number of characters: 49):
He cried for the little forsaken boy he had been.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3461 (Number of characters: 49):
He came
home, via his pain, to being on his side.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3462 (Number of characters: 100):
The long exile into self-abandonment was temporarily
over for the first time that he could remember.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3463 (Number of characters: 84):
We were then able to look at the cycle of reactivity that had turned into a cyclone.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3464 (Number of characters: 145):
Triggered by a traffic jam into the “terrible danger” of being late, Cptsd launched him into his
flight response as he raced to get to my office.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3465 (Number of characters: 139):
The flight response also immediately triggered the
inner critic to attack him for his lateness and to catastrophize about the consequences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3466 (Number of characters: 116):
As it did
he fell deeper and deeper into shame and fear, and then ultimately into the abandonment
depression itself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3467 (Number of characters: 103):
This time however, Mario broke the flashback with his tears, as his crying released his fear
and shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3468 (Number of characters: 113):
This in turn defueled his critic and allowed his body to begin releasing the
hyperarousal of his flight response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3469 (Number of characters: 290):
Had he not been able to do this, he most likely would have continued attacking himself with
shame-fueled perfectionism and fear-fueled drasticizing. He would then have launched out of the
session back to obsessively and compulsively racing through his day driven by his infinite to-do
list.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3470 (Number of characters: 155):
The Layers Of Dissociation In The Cycle Of Reactivity
All the layered reactions in the cycle of reactivity are defenses against the abandonment
depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3471 (Number of characters: 72):
Each layer is also a defense against all of the other layers beneath it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3472 (Number of characters: 46):
As such, each
layer is a type of dissociation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3473 (Number of characters: 143):
When we are triggered and lost in a 4F response, we fight, flee,
freeze or fawn to disassociate ourselves from the painful voice of the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3474 (Number of characters: 96):
On a deeper layer,
the critic is also distracting and disassociating us from our emotional pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3475 (Number of characters: 109):
Moreover, fear and
shame dis-associate us from the bottom layer - the terrible abandonment depression itself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3476 (Number of characters: 12):
Dissociation

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3477 (Number of characters: 134):
[the psychological term for disassociation], then, is the process of rendering all
these levels less conscious or totally unconscious.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3478 (Number of characters: 309):
As recovery progresses and we learn to stay present enough to the critic to begin shrinking
it, we become increasingly aware of the fear and shame that underlies it. With sufficient feeling
into fear and shame, we notice that fear and shame cover up the deadened feelings of the
abandonment depression itself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3479 (Number of characters: 138):
Learning to stay self-supportingly present to the feelings of this
depression is the deepest level, bottom-of-the-barrel work of recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3480 (Number of characters: 73):
When we are able to do
this, our recovering has reached a profound level.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3481 (Number of characters: 191):
Parental Abandonment Creates Self-Abandonment
Once again, we had to dissociate with these layered defenses because we were not
developmentally capable of managing the pain of being abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3482 (Number of characters: 142):
We could not tolerate feeling
the fear, shame and inconsolableness of it. We could not use our anger and tears to release this
shame and fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3483 (Number of characters: 103):
We could not bear to stay tuned in to the incessantly persecutory critic, over
which we were powerless.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3484 (Number of characters: 42):
We could only fight, flee, freeze or fawn.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3485 (Number of characters: 67):
Over time this elaborate
cycle of self-abandonment became habitual.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3486 (Number of characters: 49):
Chronic emotional abandonment devastates a child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3487 (Number of characters: 63):
It naturally makes her feel and appear

deadened and depressed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3488 (Number of characters: 76):
Functional parents respond to a child’s depression with concern and
comfort.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3489 (Number of characters: 387):
Abandoning parents respond to the child with anger, disgust and/or further
abandonment, which in turn exacerbate the fear, shame and despair that become the
abandonment mélange. Deconstructing Self-Abandonment
Because of our parents’ rejection, the mildest hint of depression, no matter how functional or
appropriate, can instantly flash us back into our original abandonment depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3490 (Number of characters: 110):
The capacity
to self-nurturingly weather any experience of depression, no matter how mild, remains
unrealized.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3491 (Number of characters: 92):
Our original experience of parental abandonment has morphed into habitual self-
abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3492 (Number of characters: 150):
We can gradually deconstruct the self-abandoning habit of reacting to depression with fear
and shame, inner critic catastrophizing, and 4F acting out.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3493 (Number of characters: 226):
The mindfulness processes described
below awaken the psyche’s innate capacity to respond with compassion to depression. Mindfulness also helps us metabolize the fear and shame that we were forced to feel about being
depressed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3494 (Number of characters: 74):
Ending our reactivity to depression is typically a long difficult journey.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3495 (Number of characters: 339):
This is because our
culture routinely humiliates us for any expression of depression. It pathologizes us as if we are
violating our patriotic duty to be fully engaged in “the pursuit of happiness.”
Taboos about depression even emanate from the psychological establishment, where some
schools strip it of its status as a legitimate feeling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3496 (Number of characters: 79):
For them, depression is nothing more than a
waste product of negative thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3497 (Number of characters: 152):
Other schools reduce it simplistically to a dysfunctional state
that results from the repression of somewhat less taboo emotions like sadness and anger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3498 (Number of characters: 62):
This is
not to say that these factors cannot cause depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3499 (Number of characters: 127):
It is to say that depression is a legitimate
feeling that often contains the helpful and important information described below.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3500 (Number of characters: 197):
Depressed Thinking Versus Feeling Depressed
Healing progresses when we learn to distinguish depressed thinking [which we need to
eliminate] from depressed feeling [which we sometimes need to feel].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3501 (Number of characters: 118):
Occasional feelings of
listlessness and anhedonia [inability to enjoy our usual pleasures] are normal and existential.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3502 (Number of characters: 82):
A
modicum of ennui and dissatisfaction are part of the price of admission to life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3503 (Number of characters: 420):
Moreover, depression is sometimes an invaluable herald of the need to slow down for rest
and restoration. When depression is most helpful, it gives us access to a unique spring of
intuition, such as that which informs us that a once valued job or relationship is no longer healthy
for us. In such instances we feel depressed because some irreparable change has rendered some
central thing in our lives detrimental to us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3504 (Number of characters: 69):
This functional depression is signaling us to let it die
and move on.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3505 (Number of characters: 171):
Overreaction to depression essentially reinforces learned toxic shame. It reinforces the
person’s belief that he is unworthy, defective and unlovable when he is depressed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3506 (Number of characters: 79):
Sadly this typically drives him deeper into abandonment-exacerbating isolation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3507 (Number of characters: 176):
Mindfulness Metabolizes Depression

Deep level recovery from childhood trauma requires a normalization of depression, a
renunciation of the habit of reflexively reacting to it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3508 (Number of characters: 72):
Central to this is the development of a self-
compassionate mindfulness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3509 (Number of characters: 314):
Once again, mindfulness is the practice of staying in your body –
the practice of staying fully present to all of your internal experience. The practice of mindfulness cultivates our ability to stay acceptingly open to our emotional,
visceral and somatic experience without retreating into the cycle of reactivity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3510 (Number of characters: 147):
Steven Levine’s
beautiful book, Who Dies, is an enlightening, jargon-less and easily accessible guide book on
learning the practice of mindfulness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3511 (Number of characters: 19):
Somatic Mindfulness

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3512 (Number of characters: 164):
Because depression in Cptsd commonly morphs instantly into fear, early mindfulness work
involves staying present to the physical sensations of fearful hyperarousal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3513 (Number of characters: 115):
This technique is also
known as sensate focusing and it is the practice of feeling we explored in the last chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3514 (Number of characters: 336):
Mild
sensations of fear are muscular tightness or tension anywhere in the body, especially in the
alimentary canal. Tension in the jaw, throat, chest, diaphragm or belly also often correlates with
fear. More intense sensations of fear are nausea, jumpiness, feeling wired, shortness of breath,
hyperventilation, and alimentary distress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3515 (Number of characters: 107):
Mindfulness also involves noticing the psyche’s penchant to dissociate from these
uncomfortable sensations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3516 (Number of characters: 175):
Once again, dissociation can be the classical right-brain distraction of
spacing out into reverie or sleep, or the left-brain, cognitive distraction of worrying and
obsessing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3517 (Number of characters: 157):
Over and over, the survivor will need to rescue himself from dissociation, and gently bring
his awareness back into fully feeling the sensations of his fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3518 (Number of characters: 197):
Although sensations of fear
sometimes feel unbearable at first, persistent focusing with non-reactive attention dissolves and
resolves them as if awareness itself is digesting and integrating them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3519 (Number of characters: 208):
Somatic Awareness Can Therapeutically Trigger Painful Memories
Somatic awareness and sensate focusing sometimes opens up memories and unworked through
feelings of grief about your childhood abuse and neglect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3520 (Number of characters: 108):
This phenomenon provides invaluable,
therapeutic opportunities to more fully grieve the losses of childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3521 (Number of characters: 134):
If more pain comes up
then you can digest on your own, please consider getting someone more experienced to help you
with this process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3522 (Number of characters: 123):
With considerable practice, you can begin to exhume from your fear an awareness of the
underlying sensations of depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3523 (Number of characters: 82):
These are hypo-aroused sensations that are subtle and
barely perceptible at first.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3524 (Number of characters: 103):
They may include heaviness, swollenness, exhaustion, emptiness,
hunger, longing, soreness, or deadness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3525 (Number of characters: 80):
These sensations are initially as difficult to stay present to as those of fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3526 (Number of characters: 109):
With ongoing
practice however, focused attention also digests them as they are integrated into consciousness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3527 (Number of characters: 98):
One of the biggest challenges of mindfully focusing on depression is to not dissociate into sleep.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3528 (Number of characters: 132):
Sitting up straight in a comfortable chair can help to keep you awake and focused on fully
feeling and metabolizing your depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3529 (Number of characters: 137):
As practice becomes more accomplished, these feelings and sensations of depression can

morph into a sense of peace, relaxation and ease.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3530 (Number of characters: 130):
On special occasions, they sometimes open to
an underlying, innate core emotional experience of clarity, well-being and belonging.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3531 (Number of characters: 26):
Introspective Somatic Work

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3532 (Number of characters: 110):
I began my journey of learning how to feel by devoting a half hour daily to feeling the sensations
of my fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3533 (Number of characters: 89):
This was extremely difficult because I had survived my childhood with ADHD-like
busyness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3534 (Number of characters: 113):
I had run daily marathons of activity to keep myself one step ahead of my fear and my
shame-saturated depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3535 (Number of characters: 102):
As an adult, I reduced this to half-marathons but I was still a
busyholic, despite my relaxed persona.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3536 (Number of characters: 42):
Tuning into how wired I was, was daunting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3537 (Number of characters: 150):
In my
attempts to become more mindful, I was often exasperated by how frequently my awareness fled
my body and went back into thinking or daydreaming.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3538 (Number of characters: 142):
In the first few months, my focus wavered wildly between feeling the tense sensations of
my fear and being disrupted by inner critic thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3539 (Number of characters: 76):
I was assailed by a plethora of
catastrophizing thoughts and visualizations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3540 (Number of characters: 96):
My critic repeatedly misinterpreted my fear as if I
were still entrapped in my hazardous family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3541 (Number of characters: 59):
My critic goaded me incessantly to launch into flight-mode.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3542 (Number of characters: 144):
I was so itching to get going
that I had strange tantalizing fantasies of cleaning my apartment, normally one of my least
favorite things to do.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3543 (Number of characters: 137):
In the first year of this practice, I frequently had to white-knuckle the
handles on my chair to stay somatically present to my feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3544 (Number of characters: 96):
Otherwise, I would have been off
and running into self-medicating with excessive adrenalization.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3545 (Number of characters: 102):
Dissolving Depression By Fully Feeling It
Gradually, my focused awareness began to metabolize my fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3546 (Number of characters: 112):
Many months later, I was
typically able to relax the tense fearful sensations of a flashback within ten minutes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3547 (Number of characters: 285):
As I became
more successful at digesting my fear, I experientially discovered the rock bottom underlying core
sensations of my abandonment depression itself. Mindful merging with the subtle emotions and sensations of depression is the finishing tool
of deconstructing self-abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3548 (Number of characters: 59):
Over and over I focused on the sensations of my
depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3549 (Number of characters: 81):
Occasionally these sensations were intense, but more often they were very subtle.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3550 (Number of characters: 85):
Often it was difficult to resist the urge to fall asleep, and many times I could not.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3551 (Number of characters: 159):
At other times, I noticed how instantly my depression scared me back into fear. Simultaneously the sensations of depression also triggered me into toxic shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3552 (Number of characters: 237):
Often, I would
witness myself echoing my parents’ contempt: “…bad, lazy, worthless, good-for-nothing, stick-
in-the-mud, etc.”
Blessedly, with ongoing practice, I gradually learned to dis-identify from the toxic
vocabulary of the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3553 (Number of characters: 46):
I also learned to stay awake most of the time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3554 (Number of characters: 127):
I then found myself more
accurately naming these revisited childhood feelings: “Small, helpless, lonely, unsupported,
unloved.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3555 (Number of characters: 102):
Over time, this in turn rewarded me with a profound sense of compassion for the
abandoned child I was.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3556 (Number of characters: 154):
Moreover, I made the wonderful discovery that sensate focusing, when it has been well
practiced and developed, is the ultimate thought-stopping technique.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3557 (Number of characters: 165):
When the critic is especially

loud and persistent, shifting your awareness from thinking to feeling your sensations is a potent
way of coming home to a safer place.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3558 (Number of characters: 81):
It is, as one survivor told me, “coming home to rest in the
mother of your body.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3559 (Number of characters: 121):
In my current recovery work, I most commonly apply this mindfulness technique to
experiences of survival-mode depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3560 (Number of characters: 196):
For me this low grade manifestation of the
abandonment depression typically gets triggered by a few nights of poor sleep, which often
decreases my energy level and dulls my ability to concentrate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3561 (Number of characters: 76):
Most of my life, this feeling
experience provided rich fodder for my critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3562 (Number of characters: 143):
Over the years however, increased mindfulness
allows me to see that I typically function well enough no matter how tired or introverted I feel.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3563 (Number of characters: 162):
These days, I am sometimes even able to authentically welcome the most exhausted of these
experiences as a chance to take a break from my less essential routines.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3564 (Number of characters: 243):
I have learned how to
resist my critic’s all-or-none productivity program, and be satisfied with days of getting less
done.
Hunger As Camouflaged Depression
Feelings of abandonment commonly masquerade as the physiological sensations of hunger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3565 (Number of characters: 61):
Hunger pain soon after a big meal is rarely truly about food.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3566 (Number of characters: 92):
Typically it is camouflaged
emotional hunger and the longing for safe, nurturing connection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3567 (Number of characters: 51):
Food cannot satiate the hunger
pain of abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3568 (Number of characters: 24):
Only loving support can.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3569 (Number of characters: 66):
Geneen Roth’s book offers powerful self-help
book on this subject.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3570 (Number of characters: 320):
Even after a decade of practice, I still find it difficult to differentiate this type of attachment
hunger from physical hunger. One often reliable clue is that the sensation of longing for the
nourishment of attachment is usually in my small intestine, while physical hunger’s locus is a
little higher up in my stomach.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3571 (Number of characters: 230):
When I can take the time to meditate on this lower abdomen
sensation, I often become aware that I am in a low level flashback. Feeling through this
uncomfortable sensation typically resolves both the flashback and my false hunger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3572 (Number of characters: 221):
I believe this type of emotional hunger is at the core of most food addictions. One of the
reasons food addictions are so difficult to manage is that food was the first source of self-
comforting that was available to us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3573 (Number of characters: 112):
With the dearth of any other comfort, there is little wonder
that we came to over-rely on eating for nurturance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3574 (Number of characters: 126):
In fact, like Gabor Mate, I believe that attachment hunger is at the core of most addictive
behavior, even process addictions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3575 (Number of characters: 99):
An example of the latter is the sex and love addict’s desperate
pursuit of high intensity relating.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3576 (Number of characters: 125):
Perhaps all addictive behavior is our misguided attempts to
self-medicate deeper abandonment pain and unmet attachment needs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3577 (Number of characters: 18):
Pseudo-Cyclothymia

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3578 (Number of characters: 91):
On a parallel with false hunger, feeling tired is sometimes unrelated to sleep deprivation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3579 (Number of characters: 68):
It is
instead an emotional experience of the abandonment depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3580 (Number of characters: 190):
I believe that emotional
tiredness comes from not resting enough in a safe relationship with yourself or with another. This
emotional exhaustion often masquerades as physiological tiredness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3581 (Number of characters: 69):
Unfortunately, over time, the
two can become confusingly intertwined.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3582 (Number of characters: 100):
When our abandonment depression is unremediated, either kind of tiredness can trigger us

into fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3583 (Number of characters: 145):
This then activates the inner critic which then translates “tired” into “endangering
imperfection,” which in turn triggers us into a 4F response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3584 (Number of characters: 288):
Ironically, over-reacting to emotional tiredness eventually creates real physical exhaustion
via a process I call The Cyclothymic Two-Step. The cyclothymic two-step is the dance of flight
types or subtypes who habitually overreact to their tiredness with workaholic or busyholic
activity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3585 (Number of characters: 133):
Self-medicating with their own adrenalin, they “run” to counteract the emotional
tiredness of the unprocessed abandonment depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3586 (Number of characters: 120):
Eventually however, many exhaust themselves physically, and become temporarily too
depleted or sick to continue running.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3587 (Number of characters: 167):
At such times, they collapse into an accumulated depression
so painful, that they re-launch desperately into “flight-speed” at the first sign of replenished
adrenalin.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3588 (Number of characters: 166):
Survivors with this pattern sometimes misdiagnose themselves as bipolar because of
their abrupt vacillations between adrenalin highs and abandonment-exacerbated lows.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3589 (Number of characters: 135):
Also noteworthy here is the futile journey that many survivors undergo treating emotional
tiredness with physiologically-based methods.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3590 (Number of characters: 103):
The limited efficacy of such an approach however
typically augments their shame: “What’s wrong with me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3591 (Number of characters: 72):
I’ve changed everything in my diet and
in my sleep and exercise regimen.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3592 (Number of characters: 126):
I’ve taken every available supplement and seen every type of
practitioner imaginable, and I still wake up feeling dead tired.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3593 (Number of characters: 70):
There is a healthy way out of this cul-de-sac of misdirected striving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3594 (Number of characters: 114):
It lies in cultivating
self-kindness during those inevitable times when you feel tired, bad, lonely, or depressed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3595 (Number of characters: 101):
In this
regard, the notable AA 12 Step acronym, HALT - Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired – can be
helpful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3596 (Number of characters: 150):
Accordingly, I recommend that you focus inside to see if you have flashed back into the
abandonment depression whenever you experience a HALT feeling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3597 (Number of characters: 102):
If you have, you can then
work to generate the internal, self-compassionate attention described above.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3598 (Number of characters: 227):
Separating Necessary Suffering From Unnecessary Suffering
You can sometimes gain motivation for this difficult work by seeing your depressed feelings as
messages from your inner child who is feeling as abandoned as he ever was.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3599 (Number of characters: 105):
Perhaps this time
you can come to him with your remothering-self in a more comforting and protective way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3600 (Number of characters: 299):
Through such practice, you can gradually achieve the healing that Buddhists call separating
necessary suffering [normal fear and depression] from unnecessary suffering [unconscious self-
abandonment to helplessness, toxic shame, Cptsd fear, retraumatizing inner critic acting in, and
4F acting out].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3601 (Number of characters: 156):
Recovery Is Progressive
I begin this section by repeating the chapter 4 section: “Stages of Recovery.” This section
outlines the overall course of recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3602 (Number of characters: 127):
Hopefully you will notice, since you began reading this
book, that your understanding of Cptsd has been significantly enhanced.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3603 (Number of characters: 101):
I also hope that you
sense a greater sense of self-compassion and direction in your recovery process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3604 (Number of characters: 113):
“Although we often work on many levels of recovering at the same time, recovering is to some

degree progressive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3605 (Number of characters: 109):
It begins on the cognitive level when psychoeducation and mindfulness helps
us understand that we have Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3606 (Number of characters: 129):
This awakening then allows us to learn how to approach the
journey of deconstructing the various life-spoiling dynamics of Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3607 (Number of characters: 96):
Still on the cognitive level, we take our next steps into the long work of shrinking the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3608 (Number of characters: 168):
Some survivors will need to do a great deal of work on this level before they can move down to
the emotional layer of work, which is learning how to grieve effectively.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3609 (Number of characters: 202):
The phase of intensely grieving our childhood losses can last for a couple of years. When
sufficient progress is made in grieving, the survivor naturally drops down into the next level of
recovery work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3610 (Number of characters: 79):
This involves working through fear by grieving our loss of safety in the world.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3611 (Number of characters: 101):
At
this level, we also learn to work through our toxic shame by grieving the loss of our self-esteem.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3612 (Number of characters: 154):
As we become more adept in this type of deep level grieving, we are then ready to address
the core issue of our Cptsd – the abandonment depression itself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3613 (Number of characters: 170):
The final task here involves
releasing the armoring and physiological reactivity in our body to the abandonment depression
via the somatic work discussed in this chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3614 (Number of characters: 110):
This work culminates with learning to
compassionately support ourselves through our experiences of depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3615 (Number of characters: 194):
Finally, as we will see in the next chapter, many survivors need some relational help in
achieving the complex tasks involved in deconstructing each layer of our old pain-exacerbating
defenses.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3616 (Number of characters: 135):
A Swiss Army Knife Approach To A Flashback
This is a final example of addressing all the layers of reactivity in resolving a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3617 (Number of characters: 275):
When I started this work over three decades ago, I ate very poorly and did not know how to
soothe and nurture myself with healthy food. After some years of recovery work however, I deeply intuited that I needed to cook more in
order to take self-nurturance to the next level.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3618 (Number of characters: 54):
I had not cooked more however because I hated to
cook.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3619 (Number of characters: 143):
Luckily I embraced cooking anyway as a labor of love. Nonetheless cooking was, for a
long time, a very trying and unpleasant experience for me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3620 (Number of characters: 95):
[This was, in fact, much like my
many years of struggling to get the upper hand on the critic].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3621 (Number of characters: 77):
But back to cooking which became a central piece of my self-remothering work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3622 (Number of characters: 136):
It was not
until I understood more about the dynamics of my flight response that I realized how much I
rushed around when I was cooking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3623 (Number of characters: 142):
Via increased mindfulness, I discovered that the smallest
unforeseen obstacle could set off what felt like a small electric shock in my chest.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3624 (Number of characters: 160):
Examples of
these obstacles include something spilled, a lid too tight to open, an extra unanticipated task, or
the clock showing me that I was behind schedule.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3625 (Number of characters: 111):
In an instant, anyone of these normal
hindrances could send me rushing around the kitchen in a low grade panic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3626 (Number of characters: 109):
Whenever this
occurred, I would then inhale my meal as soon as it was ready just to get the ordeal over with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3627 (Number of characters: 236):
This is an example of what a common, everyday flashback looks like in adulthood. It is so
often minor daily frustrations that trigger us into flashbacks, rather than incidents that repeat the
gross insults and ordeals of our childhoods.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3628 (Number of characters: 168):
With ongoing recovery work, I realized that anything to do with food could easily flash me
back to the family dinner table - the battlefield of my dysfunctional family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3629 (Number of characters: 51):
Many productive grieving sessions came out of this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3630 (Number of characters: 142):
They lead me to an epiphany that

doing anything intricate with lot of steps to it also flashed me back to feeling picked apart by my
parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3631 (Number of characters: 142):
I subsequently discovered that angering at my parents, whenever I was triggered by
doing something complicated, significantly reduced my fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3632 (Number of characters: 133):
There was, however, a huge part of my food trauma that I could not shrink until I started the
somatic work described in this chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3633 (Number of characters: 115):
Since then, years of practicing somatic mindfulness has greatly reduced my hair-triggerable
anxiety around cooking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3634 (Number of characters: 41):
This is however still a work in progress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3635 (Number of characters: 115):
In terms of the cycles of
reactivity, my occasional flashbacks around food and food preparation can look like this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3636 (Number of characters: 75):
I have
thirty minutes to cook and eat my breakfast before I leave for work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3637 (Number of characters: 103):
I come into the kitchen
and… “Oh No, The sink is full of the dishes that I forgot to clean last night!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3638 (Number of characters: 148):
I immediately
notice that I am about to launch into frenzied dish washing, when Flashback Management Step#
1 rises to the front of my consciousness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3639 (Number of characters: 26):
“I am having a flashback.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3640 (Number of characters: 65):
I go directly to Step# 7 and attempt to “ease back into my body.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3641 (Number of characters: 147):
I sit in my favorite stuffed
chair, close my eyes, and bring my awareness to my abdomen, where my anxiety typically makes
its most strident charge.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3642 (Number of characters: 52):
I can feel tightness in and just below my diaphragm.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3643 (Number of characters: 86):
I feel afraid and get
a picture of my father’s big hand squeezing my small intestines.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3644 (Number of characters: 102):
I start to hypochondriasize about the possible long term effects of having this tension in my
abdomen.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3645 (Number of characters: 79):
My mindfulness instantly alerts me to invoke the thought-correction of Step# 8.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3646 (Number of characters: 89):
I
slowly repeat my current favorite anti-endangerment mantra: “I am safe; I am relaxing.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3647 (Number of characters: 185):
I slow and deepen my breath, and feel the muscles in my belly as much as I can. I feel the
slow cycle of these muscles relaxing and contracting with the ebbing and flowing of my breath.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3648 (Number of characters: 57):
The cycle gradually becomes more fluid as I attend to it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3649 (Number of characters: 109):
After about fifty inhalations, I feel a swollen sensation of tiredness diffusing like ink
throughout my body.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3650 (Number of characters: 101):
My gut momentarily retightens to ward off that awful deadening feeling of
the abandonment depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3651 (Number of characters: 32):
But I surrender to the deadness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3652 (Number of characters: 137):
I do this because I know the tight feeling is fear and that it
will soon morph into the screaming critic excoriating me about being late.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3653 (Number of characters: 100):
I say no to the critic’s
Siren call of “you can do this if you hurry,” tempting me back into flight.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3654 (Number of characters: 88):
I stay with the deadened, tired, lifeless feeling and try to feel it more, welcoming it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3655 (Number of characters: 178):
I sense
myself beginning to become one with the depressed sensation. Because I am so well practiced, the depression starts to gradually morph into a widening
sense of relaxation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3656 (Number of characters: 78):
It spreads throughout my body, and my body begins to feel like an easy-
chair.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3657 (Number of characters: 205):
I look at my watch and it has taken twenty minutes of my “precious time.” I realize my
critic is trying to sneak back in and is goading me with the remark “it has taken twenty minutes
of my precious time.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3658 (Number of characters: 96):
I disidentify from the critic and shift into my refathering self and thought-correct the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3659 (Number of characters: 42):
“It’s ok Pete, this is all small potatoes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3660 (Number of characters: 70):
You are not in danger [Step# 2], and this is definitely no
emergency.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3661 (Number of characters: 120):
I take a moment with the angering part of grieving [Step#9] and reinforce my boundaries
against my internalized parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3662 (Number of characters: 16):
“Screw you Helen

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3663 (Number of characters: 17):
[mom] and Charlie

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3664 (Number of characters: 103):
[dad] for frightening me
so much about making mistakes that I freak out when things don’t go perfectly!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3665 (Number of characters: 32):
“Ooh, that got a few nice tears.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3666 (Number of characters: 14):
What a relief.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3667 (Number of characters: 81):
How many times have I been stuck in that
driven-ness and not known how to stop?!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3668 (Number of characters: 31):
I return to thought-correction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3669 (Number of characters: 37):
“So, like I was saying Pete, it’s ok.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3670 (Number of characters: 56):
You always show up at

your office an hour early anyway.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3671 (Number of characters: 40):
You can take 20 minutes off the routine.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3672 (Number of characters: 112):
You can stay in this
relaxed state a bit longer and still have time to get everything done in a relaxed manner.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3673 (Number of characters: 132):
I feel the sense of triumph I sometimes see in my clients when they have worked hard to
successfully manage and resolve a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3674 (Number of characters: 12):
“It worked!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3675 (Number of characters: 118):
This time I broke the cycle and did
not let my triggered flight response get much further than some momentary rushing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3676 (Number of characters: 94):
I stopped the cycle of reactivity from devolving into an inner critic diatribe against myself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3677 (Number of characters: 93):
I
didn’t indulge the outer critic and let it make me try to pin the undone dishes on my wife.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3678 (Number of characters: 36):
I chose
to stay with the depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3679 (Number of characters: 134):
I bypassed the shame and fear that I have gotten stuck in ten
thousand times before when I could not accept my current state of being.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3680 (Number of characters: 146):
I refused to abandon
myself like the sinking ship I thought I was – like Helen and Charlie abandoned me as a kid on a
daily, hourly, yearly basis.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3681 (Number of characters: 87):
I am also happy to report that I now cook regularly, and triggering is relatively rare.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3682 (Number of characters: 73):
I have
even gotten to enjoy my own cooking so much that I rarely eat out.

A RELATIONAL APPOACH TO HEALING ABANDONMENT
This chapter is a reworking of a professional article I wrote to guide therapists in their Cptsd
work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3684 (Number of characters: 352):
I have kept that point of reference in many sections of this chapter in the hope that it will
help you know what it is reasonable to expect from a therapist. Further on in this chapter, there is a section on how to find a therapist. I hope this
information will help you know what to look for, and ask for, when and if you are shopping for a
therapist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3685 (Number of characters: 140):
Finally, if therapy is not an option for you, I end the chapter with guidelines on how to
create a co-counseling relationship with a friend.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3686 (Number of characters: 152):
If that also is not possible, I list
recommendations for online forums where you can interact with others who are sharing about
their recovery journeys.

The Relational Dimension Of Psychotherapy
Many Cptsd survivors have never had a “safe enough” relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3688 (Number of characters: 217):
Healing our attachment
disorders usually requires a reparative relational experience with a therapist, partner or trusted
friend who is able to stay compassionately present to their own painful and dysphoric feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3689 (Number of characters: 123):
It
is essential that they are comfortable with feeling and expressing their own sadness, anger, fear,
shame and depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3690 (Number of characters: 165):
When a therapist has this level of emotional intelligence, she can guide the client to
gradually let go of the learned habit of automatically rejecting his feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3691 (Number of characters: 110):
This in turn also helps
him to avoid getting lost in the cycles of reactivity we explored in the last chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3692 (Number of characters: 181):
Safe and empathic eye and voice connection with a therapist who has “good enough”
emotional intelligence models to the client how to stay acceptingly present to all her own affects.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3693 (Number of characters: 54):
Daniel Siegel calls this the “coregulation of affect.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3694 (Number of characters: 189):
Moreover, Susan Vaughan’s work
demonstrates that this coregulation of affect promotes the development of the inner neural

circuitry necessary to metabolize overwhelmingly painful feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3695 (Number of characters: 180):
Furthermore, there is increasing neuroscientific evidence suggesting that this process is
physiologically accomplished through the agency of a set of neurons called mirror neurons.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3696 (Number of characters: 111):
In
one experiment measuring neural activity in two monkeys, one monkey watched as the other
cracked open a nut.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3697 (Number of characters: 63):
The observer’s neural activity was identical to the performers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3698 (Number of characters: 122):
Perhaps
mirror neurons are involved when the client learns to be as non-reactive to his painful feelings as
the therapist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3699 (Number of characters: 432):
RELATIONAL HEALING IN COMPLEX PTSD
[Versions of the following article were first published in The Therapist and The East Bay
Therapist.] Many traumatologists see attachment disorder as one of the key symptoms of Complex PTSD. In
the psychoeducational phases of working with traumatized clients, I typically describe
attachment disorder as the result of growing up with primary caretakers who were regularly
experienced as dangerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3700 (Number of characters: 119):
They were dangerous by contemptuous voice or heavy hand, or more
insidiously, dangerous by remoteness and indifference.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3701 (Number of characters: 105):
Recurring abuse and neglect habituates children to living in fear and sympathetic nervous
system arousal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3702 (Number of characters: 156):
It makes them easily triggerable into the abandonment mélange of overwhelming
fear and shame that tangles up with the depressed feelings of being abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3703 (Number of characters: 144):
A child, with parents who are unable or unwilling to provide safe enough attachment, has
no one to whom she can bring her whole developing self.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3704 (Number of characters: 56):
No one is there for reflection, validation and guidance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3705 (Number of characters: 71):
No one is safe enough to go to for
comfort or help in times of trouble.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3706 (Number of characters: 127):
There is no one to cry to, to protest unfairness to, and to seek
compassion from for hurts, mistakes, accidents, and betrayals.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3707 (Number of characters: 107):
No one is safe enough to shine with, to do “show and tell” with, and to be reflected as a
subject of pride.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3708 (Number of characters: 92):
There is no one to even practice the all-important intimacy-building skills of
conversation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3709 (Number of characters: 113):
In the paraphrased words of more than one of my clients: “Talking to Mom was like giving
ammunition to the enemy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3710 (Number of characters: 51):
Anything I said could and would be used against me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3711 (Number of characters: 83):
No wonder,
people always tell me that I don’t seem to have much to say for myself.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3712 (Number of characters: 132):
Those with Cptsd-spawned attachment disorders never learn the communication skills that
engender closeness and a sense of belonging.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3713 (Number of characters: 159):
When it comes to relating, they are often plagued
by debilitating social anxiety - and social phobia when they are at the severe end of the
continuum of Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3714 (Number of characters: 87):
Many of the clients who come through my door have never had a safe enough relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3715 (Number of characters: 183):
Repetition compulsion drives them to unconsciously seek out relationships in adulthood that
traumatically reenact the abusive and/or abandoning dynamics of their childhood caretakers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3716 (Number of characters: 95):
For many such clients, we are their first legitimate shot at a safe and nurturing relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3717 (Number of characters: 155):
If we are not skilled enough to create the degree of safety they need to begin the long journey
towards developing good enough trust, we may be their last.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3718 (Number of characters: 112):
Emotional flashback management, therefore, is empowered when it is taught in the context
of a safe relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3719 (Number of characters: 251):
Clients need to feel safe enough with their therapist to describe their

humiliation and overwhelm. At the same time, the therapist needs to be nurturing enough to
provide the empathy and calm support that was missing in the client’s early experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3720 (Number of characters: 161):
Just as importantly, the therapist needs to be able to tolerate and work therapeutically with
the sudden evaporation of trust that is so characteristic of Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3721 (Number of characters: 152):
Trauma survivors do not have a
volitional “on” switch for trust, even though their “off” switch is frequently automatically
triggered during flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3722 (Number of characters: 248):
In therapy, the therapist must be able to work on reassurance and
trust restoral over and over again. I have heard too many disappointing client stories about past
therapists who got angry at them because they would not simply choose to trust them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3723 (Number of characters: 119):
As the importance of this understanding ripens in me, I increasingly embrace an Intersubjective
or Relational approach.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3724 (Number of characters: 243):
That means that I believe that the quality of the clients’ relationship with
me can provide a corrective emotional experience that saves them from being doomed to a
lifetime of superficial connection, or worse, social isolation and alienation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3725 (Number of characters: 210):
Moreover, I notice that without the development of a modicum of trust with me, my Cptsd
clients are seriously delimited in their receptivity to my guidance, as well as to the ameliorative
effects of my empathy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3726 (Number of characters: 188):
In this regard then, I will describe four key qualities of relating that I believe are essential to
the development of trust, and the subsequent relational healing that can come out of it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3727 (Number of characters: 96):
These are
Empathy, Authentic Vulnerability, Dialogicality and Collaborative Relationship Repair.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3728 (Number of characters: 10):
1. EMPATHY

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3729 (Number of characters: 130):
I used to assume that the merits of empathy were a given, but I have sadly heard too many stories
of empathy-impoverished therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3730 (Number of characters: 196):
In this regard, I will simply say here that if we are hard and
unsympathetic with our clients, we trigger the same sense of danger and abandonment in them
that they experienced with their parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3731 (Number of characters: 187):
In terms of a definition, I especially like Kohut’s statement that: “Empathy involves
immersing yourself in another’s psychological state by feeling yourself into the other’s
experience.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3732 (Number of characters: 225):
When I delve deeply enough into a client’s experience, no matter how initially perplexing
or intemperate it may at first seem, I inevitably find psychological sense in it, especially when I
recognize its flashback components.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3733 (Number of characters: 160):
In fact, I can honestly say that I have never met a feeling or
behavior that did not make sense when viewed through the lenses of transference and
traumatology.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3734 (Number of characters: 516):
Empathy, of course, deepens via careful listening and full elicitation of the client’s
experience, along with the time-honored techniques of mirroring and paraphrasing which show
the client the degree to which we get him. Noticing my subjective free associations often enhances my empathic attunement and
ability to reflect back to the client in an emotionally accurate and validating way. When
appropriate, I sometimes share my autobiographical free associations with the client when they
are emotionally analogous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3735 (Number of characters: 75):
I do this to let her know that I really empathize with what she is
sharing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3736 (Number of characters: 27):
This is an example of this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3737 (Number of characters: 114):
My client tells me with great embarrassment that she stayed
home all weekend because she had a pimple on her nose.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3738 (Number of characters: 59):
She is ashamed of the pimple and of
her “vanity’’ about it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3739 (Number of characters: 75):
She moans: “How could I be so stupid to let such a little thing bother me?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3740 (Number of characters: 66):
I suddenly remember cancelling a date once when I had a cold sore.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3741 (Number of characters: 53):
At the time, I also got lost in
a toxic shame attack.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3742 (Number of characters: 56):
I share this with her, minus present day shame about it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3743 (Number of characters: 63):
She tears up and
then laughs, relieved as her shame melts away.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3744 (Number of characters: 74):
Months later, she tells me that her trust in me
mushroomed at that moment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3745 (Number of characters: 90):
Guidelines for being judicious about this kind of self-disclosure
will be discussed below.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3746 (Number of characters: 131):
Of the many benefits of empathy, the greatest is perhaps that it models and teaches self-
empathy, better known as self-acceptance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3747 (Number of characters: 150):
To the degree that we attune to and welcome all of the
client’s experience, to that same degree can the client learn to welcome it in her- or himself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3748 (Number of characters: 2):
2.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3749 (Number of characters: 366):
AUTHENTIC VULNERABILITY “Realationship” Makes Healthy
Relationship
Authentic vulnerability is a second quality of intimate relating. Authentic vulnerability often
begins with emotionally reverberating with the client. I have found that emotional reflection of
the client’s feelings is irreplaceable in fostering the development of trust and real relational
intimacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3750 (Number of characters: 145):
Emotional reflection requires the therapist to be emotionally vulnerable himself and reveal
that he too feels mad, sad, bad and scared sometimes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3751 (Number of characters: 159):
Modeling vulnerability, as with empathy,
demonstrates to the client the value of being vulnerable and encourages her to risk wading into
her own vulnerability.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3752 (Number of characters: 148):
I came to value therapeutic vulnerability the hard way via its absence in my own therapy
with a therapist who was of the old, “blank screen” school.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3753 (Number of characters: 122):
She was distant, laconic and over-
withholding in her commitment to the psychoanalytic principle of “optimal frustration.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3754 (Number of characters: 521):
Therapy
with her was actually counter-therapeutic and shame-exacerbating for me as we reenacted a
defective child/perfect parent dynamic. Therapeutic Emotional Disclosure
Thankfully, I eventually realized that I had unresolved attachment issues, and sought out a
Relational therapist who valued the use of her own vulnerable and emotionally authentic self as a
tool in therapy. Her tempered and timely emotional self-disclosures helped me to deconstruct the veneer of
invincibility I had built as a child to hide my pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3755 (Number of characters: 52):
Here are some examples that were especially
helpful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3756 (Number of characters: 33):
“God, the holidays can be awful.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3757 (Number of characters: 40):
“I get scared when I teach a class too.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3758 (Number of characters: 14):
“I’m so sorry.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3759 (Number of characters: 28):
I just missed what you said.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3760 (Number of characters: 84):
I got a little distracted by my anxiety about my dental appointment
this afternoon.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3761 (Number of characters: 111):
“I feel sad that your mother was so mean to you.” “It makes me angry that you
were so bullied by your parents.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3762 (Number of characters: 202):
My therapist’s modeling that anger, sadness, fear, and depression were emotions that could
be healthily expressed helped me to renounce the pain-repressing, emotional perfectionism in
which I was mired.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3763 (Number of characters: 75):
With her, I learned to stop burying my feelings in the hope of being loved.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3764 (Number of characters: 115):
I
renounced my just-get-over-it philosophy and embraced vulnerability as a way of finally getting

close to people.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3765 (Number of characters: 180):
I needed this kind of modeling, as so many of my clients have, to begin to emerge from my
fear of being attacked, shamed or abandoned for feeling bad and having dysphoric feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3766 (Number of characters: 188):
In
order to let go of my Sisyphean salvation fantasy of achieving constant happiness, I needed to
experience that all the less than shiny bits of me were acceptable to another human being.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3767 (Number of characters: 145):
Seeing
that she was comfortable with and accepting of her own unhappy feelings eventually convinced
me that she really was not disgusted by mine.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3768 (Number of characters: 255):
The therapist’s judicious use of emotional self-disclosure helps the client move out of the
slippery, shame-lined pit of emotional perfectionism. Here are some self-revealing things that I
say to encourage my clients to be more emotionally self-accepting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3769 (Number of characters: 47):
“I feel really sad about what
happened to you.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3770 (Number of characters: 70):
“I feel really angry that you got stuck with such a god-awful family.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3771 (Number of characters: 381):
“When
I’m temporarily confused and don’t know what to say or do, I…” “When I’m having a shame
attack, I…” “When something triggers me into fear, I…” “When my inner critic is overreacting,
I remind myself of the Winnicottian concept that I only have to be a ‘good enough person.’”
Here are two examples of emotional self-disclosure that are fundamental tools of my
therapeutic work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3772 (Number of characters: 89):
I repeatedly express my genuine indignation that the survivor was taught to
hate himself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3773 (Number of characters: 96):
Over time, this often awakens the survivor’s instinct to also feel incensed about this
travesty.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3774 (Number of characters: 64):
This then empowers him to begin standing up to the inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3775 (Number of characters: 107):
This in turn aids him to
emotionally invest in the multidimensional work of building healthy self-advocacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3776 (Number of characters: 95):
Furthermore, I also repeatedly respond with empathy and compassion to the survivor’s
suffering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3777 (Number of characters: 84):
With time, this typically helps to awaken the recoveree’s capacity for self-empathy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3778 (Number of characters: 108):
She then gradually learns to comfort herself when she is in a flashback or otherwise painful life
situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3779 (Number of characters: 116):
Less and less often does she surrender to an inner torture of self-hate, self-
disappointment, and self-abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3780 (Number of characters: 242):
My most consistent feedback from past clients is that responses like these - especially ones
that normalize fear and depression – helped them immeasurably to deconstruct their
perfectionism, and open up to self-compassion and self-acceptance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3781 (Number of characters: 285):
Guidelines For Self-disclosure
What guidelines, then, can we use to insure that our self-disclosure is judicious and therapeutic? I believe the following five principles help me to disclose therapeutically and steer clear of
unconsciously sharing for my own narcissistic gratification.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3782 (Number of characters: 145):
First, I use self-disclosure sparingly. Second, my disclosures are offered primarily to promote a matrix of safety and trust in the
relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3783 (Number of characters: 211):
In this vein my vulnerability is offered to normalize and de-shame the inexorable,
existential imperfection of the human condition, e.g., we all make mistakes, suffer painful
feelings, experience confusion, etc.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3784 (Number of characters: 78):
Third, I do not share vulnerabilities that are currently raw and unintegrated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3785 (Number of characters: 149):
Fourth, I never disclose in order to work through my own “stuff,” or to meet my own
narcissistic need for verbal ventilation or personal edification.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3786 (Number of characters: 153):
Fifth, while I may share my appreciation or be touched by a client’s attempt or offer to
focus on or soothe my vulnerabilities, I never accept the offer.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3787 (Number of characters: 143):
I gently thank them for their
concern, remind them that our work is client-centered, and let them know that I have an outside

support network.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3788 (Number of characters: 265):
Emotional Self-Disclosure And Sharing Parallel Trauma History Since many of my clients have sought my services after reading my somewhat autobiographical
book on recovery from the dysfunctional family, self-disclosure about my past trauma is
sometimes a moot point.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3789 (Number of characters: 136):
This condition has at the same time helped me realize how powerful
this kind of disclosure can be in healing shame and cultivating hope.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3790 (Number of characters: 213):
Over and over, clients have told me that my vulnerable and pragmatic stories of working
through my parents’ traumatizing abuse and neglect gives them the courage to engage the long
difficult journey of recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3791 (Number of characters: 188):
Now whether or not someone has read my book, I will – with appropriate clients -
judiciously and sparingly share my own experiences of dealing with an issue they have currently
brought up.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3792 (Number of characters: 108):
I do this both to psychoeducate them and to model ways that they might address their
own analogous concerns.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3793 (Number of characters: 60):
One common example sounds like this: “I hate flashbacks too.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3794 (Number of characters: 119):
Even though I get them
much less than when I started this work, falling back into that old fear and shame is so awful.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3795 (Number of characters: 121):
I also sometimes say: “I really reverberate with your feelings of hopelessness and
powerlessness around the inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3796 (Number of characters: 73):
In the early stages of this work, I often felt
overwhelmingly frustrated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3797 (Number of characters: 58):
It seemed that trying to shrink it actually made it worse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3798 (Number of characters: 130):
But now
after ten thousand repetitions of thought-stopping and thought-correction, my critic is a mere
shadow of its former self.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3799 (Number of characters: 60):
A final example concerns a purely emotional self-disclosure.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3800 (Number of characters: 160):
When a client is verbally
ventilating about a sorrowful experience, I sometimes allow my tears to brim up in my eyes in
authentic commiseration with their pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3801 (Number of characters: 107):
The first time my most helpful therapist did this with
me, I experienced a quantum leap in my trust of her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3802 (Number of characters: 114):
3. DIALOGICALITY
Dialogicality occurs when two conversing people move fluidly and interchangeably between
speaking

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3803 (Number of characters: 83):
[an aspect of healthy narcissism] and listening [an aspect of healthy codependence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3804 (Number of characters: 1):
]

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3805 (Number of characters: 666):
Such reciprocal interactions prevent either person from polarizing to a dysfunctional narcissistic
or codependent type of relating
Dialogicality energizes both participants in a conversation. Dialogical relating stands in
contrast to the monological energy-theft that characterizes interactions whereby a narcissist
pathologically exploits a codependent’s listening defense. Numerous people have reverberated
with my observation that listening to a narcissist monologue feels as if it is draining them of
energy. I have become so mindful of this dynamic that, in a new social situation, a sudden sense of
tiredness often warns me that I am talking with a narcissist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3806 (Number of characters: 107):
How different than the elevation I
sense in myself and my fellow conversant in a truly reciprocal exchange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3807 (Number of characters: 61):
Again, I wonder if
there are mirror neurons involved in this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3808 (Number of characters: 174):
I was appalled the other day while perusing a home shopping catalog to see a set of coffee
cups for sale that bore the monikers “Designated Talker” and “Designated Listener”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3809 (Number of characters: 118):
My wife

and I pondered it for a few minutes, and hypothesized that it had to be a narcissist who designed
those mugs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3810 (Number of characters: 128):
We imagined we could see the narcissists who order them presenting them to their
favorite sounding boards as Christmas presents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3811 (Number of characters: 126):
In therapy, dialogicality develops out of a teamwork approach – a mutual brainstorming
about the client’s issues and concerns.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3812 (Number of characters: 100):
Such an approach cultivates full exploration of
ambivalences, conflicts and other life difficulties.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3813 (Number of characters: 95):
Dialogicality is enhanced when the therapist offers feedback from a take-it-or-leave-it
stance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3814 (Number of characters: 48):
Dialogicality also implies respectful mutuality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3815 (Number of characters: 188):
It stands in stark contrast to the blank
screen neutrality and abstinence of traditional psychoanalytic therapy, which all too often
reenacts the verbal and emotional neglect of childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3816 (Number of characters: 206):
I believe abstinence commonly flashes the client back into feelings of abandonment, which
triggers them to retreat into “safe” superficial disclosure, ever-growing muteness and/or early
flight from therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3817 (Number of characters: 134):
Meeting Healthy Narcissistic Needs
All this being said, extensive dialogicality is often inappropriate in the early stages of therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3818 (Number of characters: 132):
This is especially true, when the client’s normal narcissistic needs have never been gratified, and
remain developmentally arrested.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3819 (Number of characters: 52):
In such cases, clients need to be extensively heard.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3820 (Number of characters: 135):
They need to discover through the
agency of spontaneous self-expression the nature of their own feelings, needs, preferences and
views.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3821 (Number of characters: 189):
For those survivors whose self-expression was especially decimated by their caretakers,
self-focused verbal exploration typically needs to be the dominant activity for a great deal of
time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3822 (Number of characters: 90):
Without this, the unformed healthy ego has no room to grow and break free from the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3823 (Number of characters: 100):
The client’s healthy sense of self remains imprisoned beneath the hegemony of the outsized
superego.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3824 (Number of characters: 224):
This does not mean, however, that the client benefits when the therapist retreats into
extremely polarized listening. Most benefit, as early as the first session, from hearing something
real or “personal” from the therapist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3825 (Number of characters: 121):
This helps overcome the shame-inducing potential that
arises in the “One-seen [client] / One-unseen [therapist]” dynamic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3826 (Number of characters: 101):
When one person is being
vulnerable and the other is not, shame has a huge universe in which to grow.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3827 (Number of characters: 175):
This also creates a
potential for the client to get stuck flashing back to childhood when the vulnerable child was
rejected over and over by the seemingly invulnerable parent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3828 (Number of characters: 217):
Consequently, many of my colleagues see group therapy as especially powerful for healing
shame, because it rectifies this imbalance by creating a milieu where it is not just one person who
is risking being vulnerable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3829 (Number of characters: 120):
In this regard, it is interesting to note a large survey of California therapists that occurred
about fifteen years ago.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3830 (Number of characters: 198):
The survey was about their therapy preferences, and upwards of ninety
percent emphasized that they did not want a blank screen therapist, but rather one who
occasionally offered opinions and advice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3831 (Number of characters: 292):
For twenty-five years, I have been routinely asking clients in the first session: “Based on
your previous experiences in therapy, what would you like to happen in our work together; and
what don’t you want to happen?” How frequently clients respond similarly to the therapists in

the survey!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3832 (Number of characters: 108):
Moreover, the next most common response I receive is that I don’t want a therapist who
does all the talking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3833 (Number of characters: 80):
More than a few have used the exact phrase: “I couldn’t get a word in
edgewise!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3834 (Number of characters: 187):
How I wish there was a way that our qualification tests could spot and disqualify the
narcissists who do get licensed and then turn their already codependent clients into sounding
boards.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3835 (Number of characters: 68):
This is the shadowy flipside polarity of the blank screen therapist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3836 (Number of characters: 172):
Psychoeducation As Part Of Dialogicality
Experience has taught me that clients who are childhood trauma survivors typically benefit from
psychoeducation about Complex PTSD.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3837 (Number of characters: 144):
When clients understand the whole picture of Cptsd
recovery, they become more motivated to participate in the self-help practices of recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3838 (Number of characters: 96):
This also increases their overall hopefulness and general engagement in the therapeutic process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3839 (Number of characters: 142):
I
sometimes wonder whether the rise in the popularity of Coaching has been a reaction to the
various traditional forms of therapeutic neglect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3840 (Number of characters: 145):
One of the worst forms of therapeutic neglect occurs when the therapist fails to notice or
challenge a client’s incessant, self-hating diatribes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3841 (Number of characters: 94):
This, I believe, is akin to tacitly approving of
and silently colluding with the inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3842 (Number of characters: 130):
Perhaps therapeutic withholding and abstinence derives from the absent father syndrome
that afflicts so many Westernized families.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3843 (Number of characters: 208):
Perhaps traditional psychotherapy overemphasizes
the mothering principles of listening and unconditional love, and neglects the fathering principles
of encouragement and guidance that coaching specializes in.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3844 (Number of characters: 93):
Too much coaching is, of course, as counter-therapeutic and unbalanced as too much
listening.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3845 (Number of characters: 101):
It can interfere with the client’s process of self-exploration and self-discovery as
described above.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3846 (Number of characters: 118):
At its worst, it can lure the therapist into the narcissistic trap of falling in love
with the sound of his own voice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3847 (Number of characters: 59):
At its best, coaching is an indispensable therapeutic tool.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3848 (Number of characters: 182):
Just as it takes fathering and
mothering to raise a balanced child, mothering and fathering principles are needed to meet the
developmental arrests of the attachment-deprived client.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3849 (Number of characters: 149):
The sophisticated therapist values both and intuitively oscillates between the two,
depending on the developmental needs of the client in the moment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3850 (Number of characters: 241):
Sometimes we guide with
psychoeducation, therapeutic self-disclosure and active positive noticing, and most times we
receptively nurture the client’s evolving practice of her own spontaneously arising self-
expression and verbal ventilation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3851 (Number of characters: 133):
Once again, I believe that in early therapy and many subsequent stages of therapy, the latter
process typically needs to predominate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3852 (Number of characters: 125):
In this vein, I would guess that over the course of most
therapies that I conduct, I listen about ninety percent of the time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3853 (Number of characters: 158):
Finally, I often notice that the last phase of therapy is often characterized by increasing
dialogicality – a more balanced fluidity of talking and listening.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3854 (Number of characters: 76):
This conversational reciprocity
is a key characteristic of healthy intimacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3855 (Number of characters: 144):
Moreover, when therapy is successful, progress in
mutuality begins to serve the client in creating healthier relationships in the outside world.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3856 (Number of characters: 149):
Dialogicality And The 4F’s

Because of childhood abandonment and repetition compulsion in later relationships, many 4F
types are “dying” to be heard.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3857 (Number of characters: 95):
Different types however vary considerably in their dialogical
needs over the course of therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3858 (Number of characters: 202):
The Fawn/ Codependent type, who survived in childhood by becoming a parent’s sounding
board or shoulder to cry on, may use her listening defense to encourage the therapist to do too
much of the talking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3859 (Number of characters: 112):
With her eliciting defense, she may even invoke the careless therapist into
narcissistically monologing himself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3860 (Number of characters: 183):
The Freeze/Dissociative type, who learned early to seek safety in the camouflage of silence,
often needs a great deal of encouragement to discover and talk about his inner experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3861 (Number of characters: 126):
Psychoeducation can help him understand how his healthy narcissistic need to express himself
was never nurtured in his family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3862 (Number of characters: 150):
Furthermore, freeze types can easily get lost in superficial and barely relevant free
associations as they struggle to learn to talk about themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3863 (Number of characters: 202):
This of course needs to be
welcomed for some time, but eventually we must help him see that his flights of fantasy or
endless dream elaborations are primarily manifestations of his dissociative defense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3864 (Number of characters: 171):
Freeze types need to learn that emotionally disconnected talking is an old childhood habit
that was developed to keep them buoyant above their undealt with emotional pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3865 (Number of characters: 133):
Because of
this, we must repeatedly guide them toward their feelings so that they can learn to express their
most important concerns.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3866 (Number of characters: 139):
The Fight/Narcissistic type, who often enters therapy habituated to holding court, typically
dodges real intimacy with her talking defense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3867 (Number of characters: 155):
Therapy can actually be counterproductive for
these types as months or years of uninterrupted monologing in sessions exacerbate their sense of
entitlement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3868 (Number of characters: 149):
By providing a steady diet of uninterrupted listening, the therapist strengthens their
intimacy-destroying defense of over-controlling conversations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3869 (Number of characters: 104):
Sooner or later, we must insert
ourselves into the relationship to work on helping them learn to listen.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3870 (Number of characters: 205):
As I write this, I remember Harry from my internship whose tiny capacity to listen to his
wife evaporated as my fifty minutes of uninterrupted listening became his new norm and
expectation in relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3871 (Number of characters: 141):
I felt guilty when I learned this from listening to a recorded message
from his wife about how therapy was making him even more insufferable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3872 (Number of characters: 147):
I was relieved,
however, a few years later when a different client told me that Harry’s wife eventually felt happy
about this “therapeutic” change.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3873 (Number of characters: 125):
Her husband’s increased self-centeredness was the last straw for
her and she finally, with great relief, shed herself of him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3874 (Number of characters: 203):
A therapist, who is a fawn type herself, may hide in a listening and eliciting defense to avoid the
scary work of gradually insinuating herself into the relationship and nudging it towards
dialogicality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3875 (Number of characters: 71):
If we do not nudge the client to interact, there will be no recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3876 (Number of characters: 73):
For more on
how to approach this, please see the end of the next section.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3877 (Number of characters: 98):
The Flight/Obsessive-compulsive type sometimes presents as being more dialogical than
other types.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3878 (Number of characters: 122):
Like the freeze type, however, he can obsess about “safe” abstract concerns that are
quite removed from his deeper issues.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3879 (Number of characters: 151):
It is therefore up to the therapist to steer him into his
deeper, emotionally based concerns to help him learn a more intimacy-enhancing dialogicality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3880 (Number of characters: 190):
Otherwise, the flight type can remain stuck and floundering in obsessive perseverations about

superficial worries that are little more than left-brain dissociations from his repressed pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3881 (Number of characters: 148):
It is important to note here that all 4F types use left- or right-brain dissociative processes to
avoid feeling and grieving their childhood losses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3882 (Number of characters: 144):
As dialogicality is established, it can then be
oriented toward helping them to uncover and verbally and emotionally vent their ungrieved
hurts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3883 (Number of characters: 159):
4. COLLABORATIVE RAPPORT REPAIR
Collaborative rapport repair is the process by which relationships recover and grow closer from
successful conflict resolution.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3884 (Number of characters: 94):
Misattunements and periods of disaffection are existential to every
relationship of substance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3885 (Number of characters: 133):
We all need to learn a process for restoring intimacy when a
disagreement temporarily disrupts our feeling of being safely connected.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3886 (Number of characters: 159):
I believe most people, if they think about it, realize that their best friends are those with
whom they have had a conflict and found a way to work through it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3887 (Number of characters: 144):
Once a friendship survives a
hurtful misattunement, it generally means that it has moved through the fair-weather-friends
stage of relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3888 (Number of characters: 107):
Synchronistic with re-editing this last section, my son uncharacteristically got into a conflict
at school.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3889 (Number of characters: 151):
During third grade recess two of his good friends, also uncharacteristically, started
teasing him, and when they would not stop he pushed each of them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3890 (Number of characters: 54):
This earned them all a trip to
the principal’s office.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3891 (Number of characters: 64):
The principal is a strict but exceptionally wise and kind woman.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3892 (Number of characters: 225):
My son’s
offense, using physical force to resolve a conflict, was judged as the most serious violation of
school policy, but his friends’ were also held responsible for their part and given an enlightening
lecture on teasing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3893 (Number of characters: 66):
My son, not used to being in trouble, had a good cry about it all.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3894 (Number of characters: 115):
He then agreed that a one
day loss of recess plus writing letters of apology to his friends were fair consequences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3895 (Number of characters: 86):
Two days
later, I asked him how things were going now between him and the two friends.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3896 (Number of characters: 75):
With a look of
surprise and delight, he told me: “It’s really funny, daddy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3897 (Number of characters: 66):
Now, it feels like we’re even better
friends than we were before.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3898 (Number of characters: 105):
Rapport repair is probably the most transformative, intimacy-building process that a therapist can
model.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3899 (Number of characters: 133):
I guide this process from a perspective that recognizes that there is usually a mutual
contribution to any misattunement or conflict.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3900 (Number of characters: 90):
Therefore, a mutually respectful dialogical process
is typically needed to repair rapport.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3901 (Number of characters: 96):
Exceptions to this include scapegoating and upsets that are
instigated by a bullying narcissist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3902 (Number of characters: 46):
In those situations, they are solely at fault.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3903 (Number of characters: 131):
I have often been
saddened by codependent clients who apologize to their bullying parents as if they made their
parents abuse them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3904 (Number of characters: 101):
In more normal misattunements, I often initiate the repair process with two contiguous
interventions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3905 (Number of characters: 87):
Firstly, I identify the misattunement [e.g., “I think I might have misunderstood
you.”]

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3906 (Number of characters: 114):
And secondly, I then model vulnerability by describing what I think might be my
contribution to the disconnection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3907 (Number of characters: 155):
Abbreviated examples of this are: “I think I may have just been somewhat preachy…or
tired…or inattentive…or impatient…or triggered by my own transference.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3908 (Number of characters: 119):
Owning your part in

a conflict validates the normality of relational disappointment and the art of amiable resolution.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3909 (Number of characters: 155):
Taking responsibility for your role in a misunderstanding also helps to deconstruct the
client’s outer critic belief that relationships have to be perfect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3910 (Number of characters: 178):
At the same time, it models a
constructive approach to resolving conflicts, and over time leads most clients to become
interested in exploring their contribution to the conflict.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3911 (Number of characters: 91):
This becomes an invaluable skill which
they can then take into their outside relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3912 (Number of characters: 133):
As one might expect, fight types are the least likely of the 4F’s to collaborate and own their
side of the street in a misattunement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3913 (Number of characters: 167):
Extreme fight types such as those diagnosed with
Narcissistic Personality Disorder have long been considered untreatable in traditional
psychoanalysis for this reason.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3914 (Number of characters: 123):
With less extreme fight types, I sometimes succeed in psycho-educating them on how they
learned their controlling defenses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3915 (Number of characters: 77):
From there I try to help them see how much they pay for being
so controlling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3916 (Number of characters: 56):
At the top of the list of debits is intimacy-starvation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3917 (Number of characters: 101):
Consciously or not, they
hunger for human warmth and they do not get it from those whom they control.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3918 (Number of characters: 102):
Victims of fight
types are too afraid of them to relax enough to generate authentically warm feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3919 (Number of characters: 193):
Finally, I believe one of the most common reasons that clients terminate prematurely is the
gradual accumulation of dissatisfactions that they do not feel safe enough to bring up or talk
about.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3920 (Number of characters: 160):
How sad it is that all kinds of promising relationships wither and die from an individual or
couple’s inability to safely work through differences and conflict.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3921 (Number of characters: 103):
Please see Toolbox 4 in
chapter 13 for a list of many pragmatic tools to “Lovingly Resolving Conflict.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3922 (Number of characters: 142):
Moving Through Abandonment Into Intimacy: A Case Study
A sweet, freeze-fawn client of mine suffered severe emotional abandonment in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3923 (Number of characters: 34):
Both
his parents were workaholics.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3924 (Number of characters: 50):
They were, by definition, exceedingly unavailable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3925 (Number of characters: 139):
As the
youngest of five children, Frank always finished last in the sibling competition for the paltry
caretaking his parents had to offer.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3926 (Number of characters: 96):
His adulthood was unfortunately a reenactment of the
relational impoverishment of his childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3927 (Number of characters: 66):
Childhood trauma left Frank hair-triggered to retreat and isolate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3928 (Number of characters: 50):
He had never experienced
an enduring relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3929 (Number of characters: 92):
As a result of our long-term work, however, he became more motivated
to seek a relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3930 (Number of characters: 54):
He successfully dated a healthy and available partner.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3931 (Number of characters: 116):
For the first six
months of their relationship, my coaching and her kind nature enabled him to show more of
himself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3932 (Number of characters: 89):
He was rewarded by increasing feelings of relaxation and comfort while relating with
her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3933 (Number of characters: 119):
When he accepted her request to move in together, however, it became harder to hide his
recurring emotional flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3934 (Number of characters: 129):
He was more convinced than ever that his feelings of fear, shame
and depression were the most despicable of his many fatal flaws.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3935 (Number of characters: 158):
As we worked with this belief in therapy, he remembered many times when even the
mildest dip in his mood triggered his mother to retreat into her home office.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3936 (Number of characters: 139):
He saw that the only
times his mother had a bit of time for him was on those rare occasions when he was buoyant
enough to lift her spirits.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3937 (Number of characters: 91):
He had a staunch conviction that social inclusion depended on him

generating cheerfulness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3938 (Number of characters: 67):
Gloomy and abashed, he confessed: “That’s pretty hard for me, Pete.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3939 (Number of characters: 31):
I’m not much fun to be around.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3940 (Number of characters: 99):
A codependent defense of being perpetually pleasant and agreeable had been deeply
instilled in him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3941 (Number of characters: 117):
He could not shake off the fear that if he was not upbeat enough, his new partner
would be disgusted and abandon him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3942 (Number of characters: 54):
He reported that his flashbacks at home had increased.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3943 (Number of characters: 55):
Sometimes he felt a desperate need to isolate and hide.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3944 (Number of characters: 98):
His freeze response was so activated, that
he increasingly withdrew from his partner into silence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3945 (Number of characters: 134):
He knew that he was hiding too much in
computer activities, excessive sleeping, and marathon TV sports viewing, but he could not stop.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3946 (Number of characters: 132):
During his most intense flashbacks, his fear and self-disgust became so intense that he
invented any excuse to get out of the house.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3947 (Number of characters: 64):
He was besieged by thoughts and fantasies of being
single again.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3948 (Number of characters: 34):
His critic was winning the battle.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3949 (Number of characters: 80):
He was sure his partner was as disgusted with his
affect as his mother had been.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3950 (Number of characters: 49):
He was on the verge of a literal flight response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3951 (Number of characters: 114):
He was about to
leave, as he had before when the brief infatuation stages of his few previous relationships ended.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3952 (Number of characters: 98):
We spent many subsequent sessions managing these emotional flashbacks to his original
abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3953 (Number of characters: 94):
He understood more deeply that his silent withdrawals were evidence that he was
flashing back.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3954 (Number of characters: 92):
He then committed to rereading and using the 13 steps of flashback management
at such times.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3955 (Number of characters: 112):
With my encouragement and gentle nudging, he grieved over his original abandonment
more deeply than ever before.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3956 (Number of characters: 84):
Over and over, he confronted the critic’s projection of his mother
onto his partner.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3957 (Number of characters: 76):
At the same time, I encouraged Frank to be more vulnerable with his partner.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3958 (Number of characters: 46):
He practiced
doing this in role-plays with me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3959 (Number of characters: 80):
Encouraged by all this work, he began talking to his girlfriend
about his Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3960 (Number of characters: 63):
A good-hearted person, she responded with sympathy and support.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3961 (Number of characters: 106):
This
eventually helped him to disclose that talking vulnerably made him feel even more afraid and
ashamed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3962 (Number of characters: 194):
To his great relief, she was not only empathic but grateful for his vulnerability. She
told him that his vulnerability made her feel safer to share an even deeper level of her own
vulnerability.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3963 (Number of characters: 56):
He cried poignant tears of gratitude as he told me this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3964 (Number of characters: 60):
I commiserated with a
welling of sweet tears in my own eyes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3965 (Number of characters: 155):
Frank’s crowning achievement came some months later when he finally felt brave enough
to tell her what he was experiencing while he was actually depressed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3966 (Number of characters: 206):
This breakthrough further
enriched their intimacy. Their love expanded into those special depths of intimacy that are only
achieved when people feel safe enough to communicate about anything and everything.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3967 (Number of characters: 139):
As my client became more skilled at being vulnerable, he was rewarded with the
irreplaceable intimacy that comes from mutual commiseration.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3968 (Number of characters: 150):
Over the next year, he and his
future wife became such reliable sources of verbal ventilation for each other, that Frank no
longer needed my services.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3969 (Number of characters: 173):
Earned Secure Attachment
In therapy, clients get the most out of their session by learning to stay in interpersonal contact
while they communicate from their emotional pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3970 (Number of characters: 115):
This gradually shows them that they are
acceptable and worthwhile no matter what they are feeling and experiencing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3971 (Number of characters: 137):
As survivors realize more deeply that their flashbacks are normal responses to abnormal
childhood conditions, their shame begins to melt.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3972 (Number of characters: 55):
This then eases their fear of being seen as

defective.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3973 (Number of characters: 85):
In turn, their habits of isolating or pushing others away during flashbacks diminish.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3974 (Number of characters: 78):
Earned secure attachment is a newly recognized category of healthy attachment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3975 (Number of characters: 128):
Many
attachment therapists believe that effective treatment can help a survivor “earn” at least one truly
intimate relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3976 (Number of characters: 205):
Earned secure attachment is the good enough and intimacy-rich attachment
discussed throughout this book. I believe the principles outlined in this chapter are keys to achieving an earned secure
attachment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3977 (Number of characters: 68):
In this vein, good therapy can be an intimacy-modeling relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3978 (Number of characters: 66):
It fosters our
leaning and practicing of intimacy-making behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3979 (Number of characters: 178):
Your connection with your therapist can
become a transitional earned secure attachment. This in turn can lead to the attainment of an
earned secure attachment outside of therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3980 (Number of characters: 163):
I have repeatedly seen this result with my most
successful clients, and I am grateful to report that my last experience with my own therapy lead
me to this reward.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3981 (Number of characters: 99):
Rescuing The Survivor From The Critic
I will conclude this section with a final note to therapists.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3982 (Number of characters: 366):
The term rescuing and what it
represents has become taboo in many psychotherapy circles and in the 12-Step Movement (e.g.
AA, CODA and ACA). The word “rescuing” is often used in such an all-or-none way that any
type of active helping is pathologized. However, I believe that helping survivors out of the abyss
of emotional flashbacks is a necessary form of rescuing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3983 (Number of characters: 71):
A key place to practice healthy rescuing is in the realm of the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3984 (Number of characters: 137):
I believe there is an
unmet childhood need for rescue that I help meet when I “save” my client from the critic, the
proxy of her parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3985 (Number of characters: 28):
This is the need no one met.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3986 (Number of characters: 219):
The child was not rescued from her
traumatizing parent. This was terrible neglect on the part of the other parent, the relatives, the
neighbors or teachers who ignored the signs that she was withering from being abused.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3987 (Number of characters: 141):
Decades of trauma work have taken me to a place where my heart no longer allows me to
be silent when someone’s inner critic is on the attack.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3988 (Number of characters: 53):
Silence, in my mind, is equivalent to tacit
approval.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3989 (Number of characters: 117):
I can no longer sit quietly and not intervene when survivors abuse themselves with
their parents’ internalized voice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3990 (Number of characters: 149):
I am additionally motivated to challenge the client’s toxic critic because of the failure of my
first long-term experience of psychoanalytic therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3991 (Number of characters: 106):
My “blank screen” therapist let me
flounder endlessly in attacking myself with self-hate and self-disgust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3992 (Number of characters: 87):
Never once did she point
out that I could and should challenge this anti-self behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3993 (Number of characters: 110):
UCSF trauma expert Harvey Peskin
would call this a failure to bear witness to the traumatization of the child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3994 (Number of characters: 175):
I now vocally challenge the critic’s lies and slanders, and I try to give the survivor a hand to
climb out of the abyss of fear and shame into which the critic has pushed him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3995 (Number of characters: 116):
It took me some time to break through the dysfunctional guilt that my early training
instilled in me about rescuing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3996 (Number of characters: 148):
Now, ironically, when I feel guilty, it is sometimes because I have
regressed and let the inner critic get away with abusing my friend or my client.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3997 (Number of characters: 54):
This guilt is
actually healthy emotional intelligence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3998 (Number of characters: 72):
It comes from my empathy as a right action-call to
challenge the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3999 (Number of characters: 147):
At such times, I feel derelict in my human and professional duty if I do not

bring attention to how he is hoisting himself on his parents’ petard.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4000 (Number of characters: 173):
Gratefully, I can no longer passively collude with the internalized critical parent by failing
to actively notice it like all those other adults did while he was growing up.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4001 (Number of characters: 135):
If an adult does not
protest when a child is being attacked with destructive criticism, she is in an unspoken alliance
with the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4002 (Number of characters: 64):
The child is forced to assume contempt is normal and acceptable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4003 (Number of characters: 125):
The witnessing
adult has forsaken her/his tribal responsibility to protect the child from parents who perpetrate
child abuse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4004 (Number of characters: 159):
When I label the traumatizing behavior of the client’s parents as contemptible, I begin the
awakening of his developmentally arrested need for self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4005 (Number of characters: 118):
I model to him that he
should have been protected, and that he can now resist mimicking their abuse in his own psyche.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4006 (Number of characters: 172):
With most of my clients, this eventually encourages disidentification from the aggressor and
weakens the internalization of the attacking parent as the locus of the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4007 (Number of characters: 164):
In my own case, I felt loved by my grandmother who lived with my family, but she failed to
help me see that my parents’ vitriolic rages were wrong and not my fault.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4008 (Number of characters: 93):
In retrospect, I believe
that her neglect crystallized my belief that I deserved their abuse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4009 (Number of characters: 73):
The stage was then set for me
to morph their contempt into self-loathing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4010 (Number of characters: 52):
I did this chapter and verse for nearly two decades.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4011 (Number of characters: 155):
I have also noticed a significant difference in survivors who were helped in childhood to see that
it was not their fault that they were being traumatized.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4012 (Number of characters: 155):
When there was one witnessing adult who
sufficiently decried what was being done to them, most did not develop such a ferocious, self-
annihilating critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4013 (Number of characters: 110):
Typically this was the other parent, an enlightened older sibling, a relative, a
teacher or a kindly neighbor.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4014 (Number of characters: 188):
FINDING A THERAPIST
I have as yet to do any therapist trainings in my approach outside of the San Francisco Bay Area,
so I cannot make any recommendations for therapists outside this area.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4015 (Number of characters: 196):
However, because my
approach is compatible with that of John Bradshaw’s, I refer people to a website that lists
therapists around the U. S. and the World who report that they embrace his approach.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4016 (Number of characters: 56):
The link to
this is www.creativegrowth.com/referral.htm.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4017 (Number of characters: 141):
I and the Creative Growth Center are however unable to personally endorse these therapists
as we are not personally familiar with their work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4018 (Number of characters: 51):
Nonetheless, I think this is a good place to
start.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4019 (Number of characters: 725):
Please begin by first reading the following recommendations for interviewing a therapist. The purpose of the interview is to ascertain whether your potential therapist is able and
willing to work at the levels I describe above. I recommend interviewing and having a trial
appointment with at least three therapists, if possible, to determine if their approach is
compatible enough with the one I describe above. A suitable therapist will be happy to answer your question about their approach and
generally talk with you on the phone for at least five minutes before scheduling a meeting. Should the therapist respond to you in an aloof, critical or shaming way, I would immediately

cross them off your list and keep looking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4020 (Number of characters: 232):
Finally, it is important to note that there are many untherapized therapists who are licensed
to practice psychotherapy, and my experience is that these types are rarely able to work at the
depth required for guiding Cptsd recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4021 (Number of characters: 94):
I believe it’s appropriate to ask a prospective therapist if they have done their own therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4022 (Number of characters: 94):
I would then at least expect from him/her a response that they have and have found it helpful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4023 (Number of characters: 109):
Ideally, the therapist would also be willing to disclose that they have done their own family of
origin work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4024 (Number of characters: 207):
Further guidance on how to find a therapist can be found at www.alice-miller.com. Click on
“articles” at the top, and then on the next page in the left column, click on “FAQ How to find the
right therapist.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4025 (Number of characters: 124):
This is a very helpful website – the website of “The” Alice Miller, who wrote the
great book: The Drama of The Gifted Child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4026 (Number of characters: 25):
Good luck in your search.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4027 (Number of characters: 121):
If you live in a reasonable sized city and persevere, I think your
chances of finding a “good enough” therapist are good.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4028 (Number of characters: 39):
Finding An Online Or Live Support Group

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4029 (Number of characters: 135):
If you cannot afford or find helpful enough therapy, there are many types of self-help groups that
are free and powerfully therapeutic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4030 (Number of characters: 114):
Moreover, if you are in therapy, your recovery process may
be enhanced by using any of the resources that follows.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4031 (Number of characters: 317):
Here are some websites that have been
repeatedly recommended to me:
www.outofthefog.org
www.ptsdforum.org
www.coda.org is the URL for Codependents Anonymous, one of my favorites, which can
be especially helpful for anyone who is a fawn type or subtype.
www.ascasupport.org for survivors of childhood abuse in general.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4032 (Number of characters: 80):
www.adultchildren.org provides support for ACA’s – Adult Children of Alcoholics.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4033 (Number of characters: 57):
www.siawso.org is a helpful site for survivors of incest.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4034 (Number of characters: 128):
www.standagainstdv.org is a site for those survivors whose childhood abuse has lead them
to become victims of domestic violence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4035 (Number of characters: 171):
www.nobully.com is a very helpful website for survivors who, because of bad luck or
repetition compulsion, are stuck in a job or relationship where they are being bullied.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4036 (Number of characters: 65):
www.daughtersofnarcissisticmothers.com
www.narcissisticmother.org

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4037 (Number of characters: 167):
these last two are for recovering from being raised by a
narcissistic mother
Several of these sites also have listings of live meetings that can be attended in person.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4038 (Number of characters: 156):
The
Creative Growth Center mentioned at the beginning of the last section also offers groups for
recovering from shame and grieving the losses of childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4039 (Number of characters: 32):
They are located in Berkeley CA.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4040 (Number of characters: 159):
Finally, if none of these recommendations seem suitable, Googling “online support groups
for recovering from childhood trauma” brings up a plethora of results.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4041 (Number of characters: 334):
An important guideline for finding a safe enough online or in-person group: If you find that a
leader or member is over-dominating a group through narcissistic behaviors such as monologing,
monopolizing the time, pressuring anyone with unwanted advice or shaming anyone in anyway,
please allow yourself to leave and try another group.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4042 (Number of characters: 473):
CO-COUNSELING
If you are not able to find or afford a “good enough” therapist, and/or if you want to supplement
your current therapy as my wife and I do regularly with each other, you can look for a safe
partner who is willing to work with you to mutually evolve a co-counseling relationship. There are many forms of co-counseling. {Google “co-counseling” to learn more.} My wife and I have a simple structure for establishing a safe and healing co-counseling
relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4043 (Number of characters: 78):
We have been using this model for many years and derive great benefit from it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4044 (Number of characters: 86):
I
have similarly benefitted from co-counseling with two wonderful friends in the past.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4045 (Number of characters: 91):
Please feel
free, of course to adapt the model to fit your own mutual needs and agreements.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4046 (Number of characters: 50):
Meet weekly and exchange 30 or 60 minute sessions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4047 (Number of characters: 163):
Begin with the counselee talking about all and any of his/her concerns and with the
counselor refraining from intervening other than to practice, Active Listening.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4048 (Number of characters: 76):
Active listening is based on an attitude of “unconditional positive regard”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4049 (Number of characters: 200):
It enhances the
counselee’s process of full verbal ventilation, and it uses non-directive, non-intrusive verbal
feedback to let the counselee know that you are attuned and paying attention to him/her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4050 (Number of characters: 108):
Active listening includes responses like “un hunh” and “mmm-hmmm” as well as a
technique known as mirroring.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4051 (Number of characters: 210):
Mirroring occurs when we repeat key words or phrases that the
other person says to let them know that we are paying attention to them. Advanced mirroring occurs when we paraphrase in our own words what we hear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4052 (Number of characters: 84):
This is
only helpful however if we make an accurate translation of what’s been said.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4053 (Number of characters: 96):
Finally, the use of open-ended questions is perhaps the penultimate active listening
techniques.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4054 (Number of characters: 155):
Questions such as “Can you tell me more about that?”, “What else happened?”, and
“Do you have other thoughts and feelings about that?” can be very helpful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4055 (Number of characters: 122):
Opened ended questions stand in contrast to pointed questions which tend to limit or shape
the way the counselee responds.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4056 (Number of characters: 192):
“What do you think or feel about that?” allows the other person
greater internal exploration than “Did you feel upset about that?” which may be perceived as a
statement rather than a question.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4057 (Number of characters: 67):
It can sound like you are telling them what they should be
feeling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4058 (Number of characters: 64):
People vary in the amount of active listening they find helpful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4059 (Number of characters: 98):
Please be open to giving and
receiving feedback about how much you or the other person would like.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4060 (Number of characters: 172):
In order to establish safety and build trust, begin with a commitment to refrain from advice

giving, criticism or any kind of unsolicited feedback except active listening.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4061 (Number of characters: 127):
If and when the
desire for feedback comes up, it is best to let the counselee determine when, what kind and how
much they want.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4062 (Number of characters: 118):
Feedback is best given from a take-it or leave-it perspective
Do not give any feedback unless it is clearly asked for.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4063 (Number of characters: 369):
The counselee often does well to be
specific about the type of feedback desired, or the desire to not have any feedback; e.g., “I’d like
to just verbally ventilate about my relationship, but don’t really want any feedback about it other
than active listening.” At another point the counselee might like to say: “This is something I
would actually like some feedback on.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4064 (Number of characters: 71):
I’d like to know whether it seems that I’m perceiving my
boss clearly.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4065 (Number of characters: 209):
With enough grace, luck, respect, practice and compassion, mutual trust may eventually
come so far that you both agree to change the structure to allow for spontaneous feedback at
certain times in the session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4066 (Number of characters: 153):
Don’t rush to get there, and always reserve permission to invoke the
no-feedback guideline for any given issue, session or indefinite number of sessions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4067 (Number of characters: 98):
In this vein, my wife or I might say to each other: “I think I’d just like active listening
today.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4068 (Number of characters: 128):
I’d like to just extensively free associate on and explore this anxious feeling in my chest
without getting any input about it.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4069 (Number of characters: 37):
Practice therapeutic confidentiality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4070 (Number of characters: 50):
Let what is said in a session stay in the session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4071 (Number of characters: 185):
I also recommend that both partners read Toolbox 4 in chapter 13, and the section above on
the four key qualities of relational healing prior to commencing a co-counseling relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4072 (Number of characters: 131):
FORGIVENESS: BEGIN WITH THE SELF
This chapter is a reworking of an article of mine that was published in Recovering, November
1991.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4073 (Number of characters: 106):
I wrote it because I was appalled at how much pressure my clients were getting to just
forgive and forget.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4074 (Number of characters: 115):
Consequently, many of them were diving right back into denial, and
minimizing all the trauma that they had endured.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4075 (Number of characters: 115):
Their recovery processes then, screeched to a
halt as their inner critics denigrated them for being so unforgiving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4076 (Number of characters: 227):
Because this article was helpful to my clients and because I received so much positive
feedback from the recovery community, I was motivated to write my first book, The Tao of Fully
Feeling, Harvesting Forgiveness Out of Blame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4077 (Number of characters: 87):
This book explores the complex subject of
forgiving past abusers in considerable depth.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4078 (Number of characters: 99):
In this vein, it asserts that some parents were so
destructive to us, that they are not forgivable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4079 (Number of characters: 152):
There is a lot of shaming, dangerous and inaccurate “guidance” put out about forgiveness in both
the recovery community and in many spiritual teachings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4080 (Number of characters: 455):
Many survivors of dysfunctional
families have been injured by the simplistic, black-and-white advice that they must embrace a
position of being totally and permanently forgiving in order to recover. Unfortunately, those who take the advice to forgive abuses that they have not fully grieved,
abuses that are still occurring, and/or abuses so heinous they should and could never be forgiven,
often find themselves getting nowhere in their recovery process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4081 (Number of characters: 224):
In fact, the possibility of attaining real feelings of forgiveness is usually lost when there is a
premature, cognitive decision to forgive. This is because premature forgiveness mimics the
defenses of denial and repression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4082 (Number of characters: 88):
It keeps unprocessed feelings of anger and hurt about
childhood trauma out of awareness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4083 (Number of characters: 62):
Real forgiveness is quite distinct from premature forgiveness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4084 (Number of characters: 163):
It is almost always a byproduct of
effective grieving and no amount of thought, intention or belief can bring it into being without a
great deal of emotional work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4085 (Number of characters: 674):
Conversely, belief systems that are not open to the possibility of forgiveness sometimes
block our access to forgiving feelings, even when such feelings are present. It might be that the healthiest cognitive position concerning forgiveness is an attitude that
allows for the possibility of its occurrence on the other side of extensive grieving. This attitude
works best if it includes the condition that feelings of forgiveness will not be forced or falsely
invoked to cover up any unresolved feelings of hurt or anger. In this vein, it is crucial to understand that certain types of abuse are so extreme and
damaging to the victim that forgiveness is simply not an option.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4086 (Number of characters: 107):
Examples of this include
sociopathy, conscious cruelty, and many forms of scapegoating and parental incest.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4087 (Number of characters: 256):
When forgiveness has substance, it is felt palpably in the heart, and is usually an expansion of
the emotion of compassion. Compassion is certainly not always the same thing as forgiveness,
but it is usually the experience within which forgiveness is born.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4088 (Number of characters: 251):
Often this happens via an
intermediate process, where having grieved our childhood losses substantially, we occasionally
find ourselves considering the extenuating circumstances that contributed to our parents raising
us in neglectful or abusive ways.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4089 (Number of characters: 72):
Most commonly these extenuating circumstances revolve around two issues.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4090 (Number of characters: 102):
First, our
parents often parented us in ways that blindly replicated the ways that they were parented.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4091 (Number of characters: 117):
And
second, they were often supported in their dysfunctional parenting by the social norms and
values of their times.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4092 (Number of characters: 229):
Nonetheless, it is once again vitally important that we do not jump into considering their
mitigating circumstances until we have significantly worked through the traumatic consequences
that their abuse and abandonment had on us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4093 (Number of characters: 207):
When considering our parents extenuating circumstances, we may sometimes “get” that our
parents were also quite victimized, and we may consequently find ourselves on occasion feeling
sorry (sorrow) for them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4094 (Number of characters: 155):
Sometimes this experience of feeling compassion for them becomes profound enough for us
to comprehend how similarly awful and unfair their childhoods were.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4095 (Number of characters: 92):
This feeling-based
realization may on occasion morph into feeling some forgiveness for them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4096 (Number of characters: 147):
However, unless this feeling of forgiveness for our parents is grounded in compassion for
ourselves, the above process is an empty mental exercise.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4097 (Number of characters: 100):
Even worse, it may become a great
hindrance to doing the fundamental angering work of real recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4098 (Number of characters: 154):
Premature forgiveness will prohibit us from showing the inner child that she had the right to
be angry about her parents’ cold-hearted abandonment of her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4099 (Number of characters: 81):
It will stop us from helping her to
express and release those old angry feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4100 (Number of characters: 113):
Premature forgiveness will also inhibit the survivor from reconnecting with his instinctual

self-protectiveness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4101 (Number of characters: 95):
He may never learn that he can now use his anger, if necessary, to stop
present day unfairness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4102 (Number of characters: 88):
As real forgiveness is primarily a feeling, it is - like all other feelings - ephemeral.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4103 (Number of characters: 61):
It is
never complete, never permanent, and never a done deal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4104 (Number of characters: 78):
Forgiveness is governed by the dynamic nature of all human feeling experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4105 (Number of characters: 103):
Our
emotional experience is a frequently changing, unchoosable and unpredictable process of the
psyche.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4106 (Number of characters: 71):
No emotional state can be induced to persist as a permanent experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4107 (Number of characters: 263):
As sad as this may
be, as much as we might like to deny it, as much as it continuingly frustrates us, and as much as
we are pressured to control and pick our emotions, they are still by definition of the human
condition, largely outside the province of our wills.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4108 (Number of characters: 210):
Forgiveness then, like love, remains a human feeling experience that is only temporarily ours. However, when we thoroughly vent our angry feelings about the past, feelings of forgiveness
become more accessible.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4109 (Number of characters: 257):
When we learn how to grieve ourselves out of abandonment
flashbacks, we reemerge into a feeling of belonging to and loving the world. Moreover, when we learn to effectively grieve through present day hurts, we quite naturally
move back into loving feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4110 (Number of characters: 142):
As our emotional flexibility matures, lost feelings of love and
forgiveness return so reliably that they can become consciously chosen values.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4111 (Number of characters: 274):
Thus, when I occasionally feel hurt by proven intimates, I may not be able to immediately
invoke loving or forgiving feelings towards them, but I know that with sufficient communication
and non-abusive venting, I will eventually return to an appreciative experience of them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4112 (Number of characters: 159):
As much as I can forgive myself, that much can I forgive others. What I often forgive in others is
an old pain of mine, released from the disgust of self-hate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4113 (Number of characters: 94):
It is an old vulnerability of mine that I
now love and welcome like a bird with a broken wing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4114 (Number of characters: 102):
Shame and self-hate did not start with me,
but with all my heart, I deign that they will stop with me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4115 (Number of characters: 56):
I will do unto myself as I would have
others do unto me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4116 (Number of characters: 104):
Carol Ruth Knox wrote a poem about loving feelings and the hide-and-seek game they seem to
play with us.

chunk 4117 (Number of characters: 30):
It comes and goes, doesn’t it?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4118 (Number of characters: 226):

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4120 (Number of characters: 188):
It would appear as if the art of loving is not whether you love or not (we all do in our
present way) but whether you trust that when love leaves, it has a reason and it will return
again.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4121 (Number of characters: 7):
Always.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4122 (Number of characters: 45):
We humans are instruments for love by design.

When love blows across us,
naturally we sing a love song.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4125 (Number of characters: 241):
And when there is no love wind to blow,
though it leaves us strange
and willow-like,
love has gone to an empty field where it fills its
wind sails again
so that it might return
and blow across our all too hungering instruments
one more time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4126 (Number of characters: 31):
What shall we do while we wait?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4127 (Number of characters: 85):
We shall weep of course -
something as lovely as love
leaves a gaping hole when gone.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4128 (Number of characters: 434):
We shall remember love in our hearts and wait
tenderly and compassionately
with ourselves
as we wander in question
and doubt
until we remember,
“Love always returns.”

BIBLIOTHERAPY AND THE COMMUNITY OF BOOKS
Bibliotherapy is a term that describes the very real process of being positively and
therapeutically influenced by what you read. As stated earlier, when it is at its most powerful,
bibliotherapy is also relationally healing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4129 (Number of characters: 83):
It can rescue you from the common Cptsd feeling of
abject isolation and alienation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4130 (Number of characters: 73):
Bibliotherapy can play an enormous role in enhancing recovery from Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4131 (Number of characters: 164):
I usually find
that my clients who make the most progress are those who augment their therapy sessions with
reading homework [self-prescribed or recommended by me].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4132 (Number of characters: 152):
This is especially true of those who further augment their reading with journaling about
their cognitive and emotional responses to what they have read.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4133 (Number of characters: 169):
I believe that journaling helps
build the new physiological and neuronal brain circuitry that occurs as we effectively meet our
developmentally arrested childhood needs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4134 (Number of characters: 99):
[For more on Journaltherapy, read the section on
verbal ventilating in chapter 5 of my first book].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4135 (Number of characters: 179):
Bibliotherapy is especially helpful for people like me who grew up in dangerous social
environments replete with adults who offered little but criticism, intimidation and disgust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4136 (Number of characters: 117):
It
equally serves those whose early lives were devoid of adults who could be looked to for safe
support and guidance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4137 (Number of characters: 193):
It was not until later in life, after I had quite a few years of group and individual therapy,
that I realized that my journey of recovering had actually begun decades before my formal
therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4138 (Number of characters: 88):
It began with all the therapeutic reading and writing I had instinctively gravitated to.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4139 (Number of characters: 130):
I
unconsciously sought the help of others in the many spiritual and psychological self-help books
that I was intuitively drawn to.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4140 (Number of characters: 117):
Without really understanding it, I gained valuable insights about how to improve the way I
treated myself and others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4141 (Number of characters: 200):
Just as importantly, I subliminally realized that there were a number of
good, safe, wise and helpful adults out there who could be trusted and who had a great deal of
wise and kind guidance to offer.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4142 (Number of characters: 83):
I remember my first deeply emotional experience of entering the community of books.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4143 (Number of characters: 130):
I was
in the library resentfully slogging through the poetry section trying to find a book for my
homework in high school English.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4144 (Number of characters: 161):
I was up to “W “and had found nothing that remotely interested me when I came to an
anthology with the picture of a very compelling looking old man on its cover.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4145 (Number of characters: 13):
Walt Whitman!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4146 (Number of characters: 88):
His epic poems Song of Myself and Song of the Open Road thrilled me and changed my life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4147 (Number of characters: 101):
He
became my hero and the first adult role model that had something useful and important to teach
me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4148 (Number of characters: 114):
His ideas became my raison d’être and gave me a hopeful plan for what I would do when I
finally escaped my family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4149 (Number of characters: 161):
Over time the authors in my community of books seemed like a small tribe of elders who I
imagined as people who would have empathy for me if I were to meet them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4150 (Number of characters: 138):
Eventually when I
achieved something of a critical mass of this awareness, I managed to take a frightening leap into
the water of therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4151 (Number of characters: 115):
I lucked out and got a good enough therapist to help me take steps in my
healing that I could not manage on my own.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4152 (Number of characters: 96):
So here are some authors [and their works] who have been especially helpful to me on my
journey.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4153 (Number of characters: 61):
These are the wise aunts and uncles I never biologically had.

--------------------------------------------------

SELF-HELP TOOLS
This chapter is composed of six toolboxes, each with a set of tools to address different recovery
issues.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4171 (Number of characters: 97):
Nonetheless, I still value these lists as indispensable adjuncts to my own journey of
recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4172 (Number of characters: 78):
I often hand out these lists to clients at appropriate times in their journey.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4173 (Number of characters: 51):
I also give
them to students who attend my classes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4174 (Number of characters: 241):
I have received a great deal of positive feedback about
how helpful they have been to enhancing recovery. My friends and clients whose recovery progresses at the greatest rate are those who
supplement their therapy with self-help activities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4175 (Number of characters: 169):
Those who print out these lists, and carry them
around or post them in a conspicuous place until they are deeply ingrained seem to take a
quantum leap in their recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4176 (Number of characters: 141):
I hope that you become immersed in these lists, and that they give you the healing support
that I have seen so many others receive from them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4177 (Number of characters: 57):
Here’s a poem that I found graffitied on a wall recently.

It was signed “Hank”:

don’t let it be clubbed into dank
submission.

chances.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4185 (Number of characters: 21):
know them, take them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4186 (Number of characters: 132):
you can’t beat death but
you can beat death in life,
sometimes.
and the more often you
learn to do it,
the more light there will
be.

your life is your life.

--------------------------------------------------

And let me reemphasize once again that recovery is not an all-or-none phenomenon.

--------------------------------------------------

It is a
gradual process marked by ongoing growth in any of these arenas, and most especially in a

TOOLBOX 4
TOOLS FOR LOVINGLY
RESOLVING CONFLICT
This is a list of techniques and perspectives I’ve gathered over the years to help couples resolve
conflict as lovingly as possible.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4385 (Number of characters: 221):
When I give it to couples that I work with, I ask them to take
time at home to read it aloud together and to discuss each one as much as necessary to see if they
can agree to adopt it as a guideline for handling conflict.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4386 (Number of characters: 144):
When I first got together with my wife eleven years ago, we spent considerable time on a
weekend trip discussing these guidelines one at a time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4387 (Number of characters: 78):
We aired our concerns, enthusiasms,
caveats and reservations about using them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4388 (Number of characters: 175):
Over subsequent years, we refined our usage of them,
and have evolved a communication style around our conflicts that has helped to keep our
intimacy healthy and ever growing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4389 (Number of characters: 75):
1. Normalize the inevitability of conflict & establish a safe forum for it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4390 (Number of characters: 64):
Discuss and
agree to as many of these guidelines as seem useful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4391 (Number of characters: 2):

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4392 (Number of characters: 59):

More on Timeouts, #16
Two of the most common reasons that relationships break up is irreconcilable differences and
irreparable damages.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4435 (Number of characters: 99):
The latter could have been prevented in many cases if couples knew how to
use timeouts judiciously.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4436 (Number of characters: 160):
This is especially true for fight-type trauma survivors, who when flashing back, can easily
lose control to the outer critic and say intimacy-destroying things.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4437 (Number of characters: 178):
Survivors benefit greatly from
learning to recognize the signs of being over-activated so that they can then take timeouts to stop
the bleeding caused by a critic on the rampage.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4438 (Number of characters: 133):
Things said in the heat of a flashback can wound deeply and engrave themselves in the
psyche of the other in ways that cripple trust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4439 (Number of characters: 276):
So much of this needless intimacy-destruction will
be prevented if both members of the couple agree that either of them can call a timeout whenever
they feel too triggered to be lovingly confrontive, or are experiencing the other as flashing back
into being overly aggressive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4440 (Number of characters: 304):
Timeouts can range from one minute to 24 hours depending on how long it takes either or
both partners to achieve good enough flashback management. Timeouts work best when the person calling them nominates a time to resume conflict
resolution, so that timeouts do not become techniques for dodging issues.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4441 (Number of characters: 78):
Timeouts can be used individually as a time to release any accumulated charge.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4442 (Number of characters: 122):
This can be
done by using the safe “angering out” techniques I describe in chapter 5 of my book, The Tao of
Fully Feeling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4444 (Number of characters: 31):
More on Transference, #19 & #20

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4445 (Number of characters: 155):
In using this list with couples, I notice that those who are most skilled in conflict resolution, have
achieved significant skill with steps 19 through 21.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4446 (Number of characters: 54):
These steps are about learning to handle
transference.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4447 (Number of characters: 166):
For trauma survivors, transference is often a type of flashback whereby we unconsciously
react to our significant others as though they were our childhood caretakers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4448 (Number of characters: 97):
When this occurs,

we displace onto them a great deal of our unresolved childhood emotional pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4449 (Number of characters: 204):
One common example of this occurs when a partner’s fair and minor complaint triggers a
torrent of rage, fear and/or shame that is left over from decades of a parent’s overwhelming and
rejecting criticism.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4450 (Number of characters: 162):
Another instance of this occurs when her failure to say what he was hoping to hear stirs up
the pain of decades of his aloof, detached mother or father’s neglect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4451 (Number of characters: 58):
All gender combinations
can of course fall into this trap.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4452 (Number of characters: 165):
The composition of most conflicts that I witness in my office eventually seems to be
approximately 90% re-experienced pain from the past and 10% actual current pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4453 (Number of characters: 176):
Harville
Hendrix’s
Getting The Love You Want, is a wonderful guide for working through this dynamic in a
way that heals childhood wounds and enhances intimacy at the same time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4454 (Number of characters: 196):
In my experience, the vast majority of conflicts between consenting adults involve a
dynamic where both people play a part and have some responsibility for a disruption in their
loving connection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4455 (Number of characters: 154):
Truly healing resolutions to conflict typically occur when each partner owns their part and
expresses an apology about their contribution to the conflict.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4456 (Number of characters: 93):
For deep level resolution this
usually includes an apologetic reference to your transference.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4457 (Number of characters: 125):
A good apology sounds something
like this of this: “I’m sorry for the amount of charge I had in expressing my disappointment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4458 (Number of characters: 94):
While I believe I have a fair complaint, the intensity with which I expressed it was too much.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4459 (Number of characters: 77):
I’m
sorry I responded to you as if you were my constantly withholding mother.
