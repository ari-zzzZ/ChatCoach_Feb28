ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I am grateful to all my lovely clients who, over the last three decades, honored me with their
brave vulnerability and authenticity. Their stories verified to me that there is an epidemic of poor
parenting, and their inspiring work proved to me that the effects of it could be largely overcome.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 8 (Number of characters: 224):
I am also grateful to the readers of my first book and to my website respondents whose
generous feedback greatly alleviated my performance anxiety about writing another book and
putting my words out there for public viewing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 9 (Number of characters: 549):
Their overwhelmingly positive support
ameliorates the fear that my words will be used as weapons against me as they so often were in
childhood. I am grateful to my good friend Bill O’Brien who gave me invaluable editorial assistance. I am grateful to all those writers listed in the Bibliography, and those unlisted, whose ideas
have fertilized my mind and helped me to write this book. I am grateful to my friends in recovery with whom I have shared the process of mutual
commiseration. We have aided each other greatly in our journeys of recovery.

chunk 17 (Number of characters: 246):
Forty years ago, I was riding on a train in India travelling from Delhi to Calcutta. I was at
the end of a failed, yearlong spiritual quest in India. Instead of enlightenment, my salvation
fantasy had only netted me despair and amoebic dysentery.

--------------------------------------------------

The latter cost me thirty pounds of

Even worse was the absolute loss of the hope that had been inflamed by reading Walt
Whitman’s “Song of the Open Road.”

But, back to the train.

chunk 22 (Number of characters: 139):
I was sitting in my cramped second class seat with the untouchables,

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 23 (Number of characters: 153):
The paper informed me
that my destination, Calcutta, was now inundated with 100,000 refugees from Bangladesh who
had just fled their flood–swamped homes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 24 (Number of characters: 283):
They were all apparently sleeping on the downtown
streets in the recesses beneath the protruding second floors of all the buildings that lined the
streets. I came in late at night and sure enough, sleeping bodies wrapped in sheets, shoulder to
shoulder, lined the streets everywhere.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 25 (Number of characters: 85):
I checked into a twenty cents-a-night hotel that a fellow

People bantered with
incredible vitality and enthusiasm, and children...children

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 33 (Number of characters: 589):
[this was the part that emblazoned on
my memory] crawled all over their parents, especially their fathers in affectionate playful
gymnastics that their fathers seemed to love as much as they did. I was flooded with a mélange of feelings unlike anything I’d ever experienced before - a
strange cocktail of relief, delight and anxiety. The anxiety I wouldn’t understand until ten years

later when I realized that envy had been percolating below the surface of my awareness. I was deeply envious of this gorgeous buffet of familial love that I had never experienced or
even witnessed before.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 34 (Number of characters: 183):
The family sitcoms – even the syrupy sweet ones - that I had watched
growing up came nowhere near creating such an authentic, tactile representation of healthy
bonding and attachment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 35 (Number of characters: 265):
When I realized what this was years later as an anthropology and social work student, I
positively flashed back to other non-industrial countries where I had seen similar scenes on a less
grand level: Morocco, Thailand, Bali, and an Aboriginal reserve in Australia.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 36 (Number of characters: 872):
These memories also viscerally informed me about the kind of relational love I had never
seen in my own or my friends’ families. As I digested this experience over the years and used it
to overcome my denial about what I had missed out on as a child, I began the decades long quest
that has lead me to write this book as well as The Tao of Fully Feeling, which precedes it. The
Tao of Fully Feeling is a companion to this book and elaborates many of the foundational
principles of this book. This book then is my hopeful effort to create a map that you can follow to heal the wounds
that come from not enough childhood love. If I am a bit repetitive at times about issues like
shrinking the critic and grieving the losses of childhood, it is my attempt to find different ways to
emphasize the great importance of engaging these themes of recovery work over and over again.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 37 (Number of characters: 124):
If you find yourself lost and not sure of how to get back onto the map, these themes will always
be key portals for reentry.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 38 (Number of characters: 1153):
I sometimes recommend that readers view the table of contents and start with whatever headings
most strike a chord. Although the book is laid out in a somewhat linear fashion, everyone’s
journey of recovering is different, and journeys can be initiated in a variety of ways. Journeys of recovering may begin when a death or great loss brings up an emotional storm
that opens up a hidden reservoir of childhood pain; or when a friend shares something about his
or her recovery process that strikes a chord; or when a book or TV show triggers a more serious
consideration of what really happened in childhood; or when something gets “opened up” in
couple’s therapy; or when a healing crisis in the form of panic attacks or a nervous breakdown
requires some outside help; or when the self-medicating strategies developed to soothe
depression and anxiety get out of control and also require outside help. I hope that readers will be able to use this book as a textbook for recovering, and that
certain sections will call you back or forward to them repeatedly, as over time and with effective
work, certain themes continue to take on ever deepening meaning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 39 (Number of characters: 219):
In this vein, you will find that the Table of Contents is quite comprehensive, and sometimes
the best way to use this book is to browse through it and then read the sections and chapters that
most capture your interest.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 40 (Number of characters: 65):
Moreover, this is not a one size fits all formula for recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 41 (Number of characters: 143):
Depending on the specific
pattern of your childhood trauma, some of the advice contained herein may be less relevant or
even irrelevant to you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 42 (Number of characters: 75):
Please then focus on the material that seems applicable and helpful to
you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 43 (Number of characters: 272):
I also hope this map will guide you to heal in a way that helps you become an unflinching source
of kindness and self-compassion for yourself, and that out of that journey you will find at least
one other human being who will reciprocally love you well enough in that way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 44 (Number of characters: 66):

PART 1
AN OVERVIEW OF RECOVERING

THE JOURNEY OF RECOVERING FROM CPTSD
I wrote this book from the perspective of someone who has Complex Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder [Cptsd], and who has experienced a great reduction of symptoms over the years. I also
wrote it from the viewpoint of someone who has discovered many silver linings in the long,
windy, bumpy road of recovering from Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 47 (Number of characters: 94):
I have also seen this type of recovering in a
number of my friends and many long term clients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 48 (Number of characters: 33):
First, the good news about Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 49 (Number of characters: 99):
It is a learned set of responses, and a failure to complete
numerous important developmental tasks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 50 (Number of characters: 63):
This means that it is environmentally, not genetically,
caused.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 51 (Number of characters: 109):
In other words, unlike most of the diagnoses it is confused with, it is neither inborn nor
characterological.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 52 (Number of characters: 23):
As such, it is learned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 53 (Number of characters: 32):
It is not inscribed in your DNA.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 54 (Number of characters: 34):
It is a disorder caused
by nurture

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 55 (Number of characters: 38):
[or rather the lack of it] not nature.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 56 (Number of characters: 85):
This is especially good news because what is learned can be unlearned and vice versa.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 57 (Number of characters: 81):
What
was not provided by your parents can now be provided by yourself and others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 58 (Number of characters: 80):
Recovery from Cptsd typically has important self-help and relational components.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 59 (Number of characters: 132):
The
relational piece can come from authors, friends, partners, teachers, therapists, therapeutic groups
or any combination of these.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 60 (Number of characters: 45):
I like to call this reparenting by committee.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 61 (Number of characters: 245):
I must emphasize, however, that some survivors of Cptsdengendering families were so
thoroughly betrayed by their parents, that it may be a long time, if ever, before they can trust
another human being enough to engage in relational healing work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 62 (Number of characters: 544):
When this is the case, pets,
books and online therapeutic websites can provide significant relational healing. This book describes a multimodal treatment approach to Cptsd. It is oriented toward the most
prevalent kind of Cptsd, the kind that comes from growing up in a severely abusive and/or
neglectful family. In this vein, the book describes a journey of healing the damage that occurs

when you suffer traumatizing abuse and abandonment. Traumatizing abuse and abandonment
can occur on verbal, emotional, spiritual, and/or physical levels.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 63 (Number of characters: 568):
Moreover, sexual abuse is
especially traumatizing. I believe that we have an epidemic of traumatizing families. Current estimates posit that one
in three girls and one in five boys are sexually abused before they enter adulthood, and recent
statistics from The Kim Foundation report that 26% of Americans over 18 have been diagnosed
with a mental disorder. When abuse or neglect is severe enough, any one category of it can cause the child to
develop Cptsd. This is true even in the case of emotional neglect if both parents collude in it, as
we will see in chapter 5.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 64 (Number of characters: 635):
When abuse and neglect is multidimensional, the severity of the Cptsd
worsens accordingly. Definition Of Complex PTSD
Cptsd is a more severe form of Post-traumatic stress disorder. It is delineated from this better
known trauma syndrome by five of its most common and troublesome features: emotional
flashbacks, toxic shame, self-abandonment, a vicious inner critic and social anxiety. Emotional flashbacks are perhaps the most noticeable and characteristic feature of Cptsd. Survivors of traumatizing abandonment are extremely susceptibility to painful emotional
flashbacks, which unlike ptsd do not typically have a visual component.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 65 (Number of characters: 233):
Emotional flashbacks are sudden and often prolonged regressions to the overwhelming
feeling-states of being an abused/abandoned child. These feeling states can include
overwhelming fear, shame, alienation, rage, grief and depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 66 (Number of characters: 235):
They also include unnecessary
triggering of our fight/flight instincts. It is important to state here that emotional flashbacks, like most things in life, are not all-or-
none. Flashbacks can range in intensity from subtle to horrific.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 67 (Number of characters: 131):
They can also vary in duration
ranging from moments to weeks on end where they devolve into what many therapists call a
regression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 68 (Number of characters: 135):
Finally, a more clinical and extensive definition of Cptsd can be found on p. 121 of Judith
Herman’s seminal book, Trauma and Recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 69 (Number of characters: 494):
An Example Of An Emotional Flashback
As I write this I recall the first emotional flashback I was ever able to identify, although I did not
identify it until about ten years after it occurred. At the time of the event, I was living with my
first serious partner. The honeymoon phase of our relationship came to a screeching halt when
she unexpectedly started yelling at me for something I no longer recall. What I do most vividly recall was how the yelling felt. It felt like a fierce hot wind.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 70 (Number of characters: 370):
I felt
like I was being blown away – like my insides were being blown out, as a flame on a candle is
blown out. Later, when I first heard about auras, I flashed back to this and felt like my aura had been
completely stripped from me. At the time itself, I also felt completely disoriented, unable to speak, respond or even think. I felt terrified, shaky and very little.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 71 (Number of characters: 124):
Somehow, I finally managed to totter to the door and get out

of the house where I eventually slowly pulled myself together.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 72 (Number of characters: 135):
As I said earlier, it took me ten years to figure out that this confusing and disturbing
phenomenon was an intense emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 73 (Number of characters: 77):
Some years later, I came to understand the
nature of this type of regression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 74 (Number of characters: 804):
I realized it was a flashback to the hundreds of times my
mother, in full homicidal visage, blasted me with her rage into terror, shame, dissociation and
helplessness. Emotional flashbacks are also accompanied by intense arousals of the fight/flight instinct, along
with hyperarousal of the sympathetic nervous system, the half of the nervous system that
controls arousal and activation. When fear is the dominant emotion in a flashback the person
feels extremely anxious, panicky or even suicidal. When despair predominates, a sense of
profound numbness, paralysis and desperation to hide may occur. A sense of feeling small, young, fragile, powerless and helpless is also commonly
experienced in an emotional flashback, and all symptoms are typically overlaid with humiliating
and crushing toxic shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 75 (Number of characters: 408):
Toxic Shame: The Veneer Of An Emotional Flashback
Toxic shame, explored enlighteningly by John Bradshaw in Healing The Shame That Binds,
obliterates a Cptsd survivor’s self-esteem with an overwhelming sense that he is loathsome, ugly,
stupid, or fatally flawed. Overwhelming self-disdain is typically a flashback to the way he felt
when suffering the contempt and visual skewering of his traumatizing parent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 76 (Number of characters: 75):
Toxic shame can
also be created by constant parental neglect and rejection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 77 (Number of characters: 158):
Early in my career I worked with David, a handsome, intelligent man who was a
professional actor. One day David came to see me after an unsuccessful audition.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 78 (Number of characters: 174):
Beside himself,
he burst out: “I never let on to anyone, but I know that I’m really very ugly. It is so stupid that
I’m trying to be an actor when I’m so painful to look at.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 79 (Number of characters: 160):
I will never forget how shocked and
disbelieving I felt at first, that such a handsome person could feel ugly, but further exploration
brought me understanding.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 80 (Number of characters: 317):
David’s childhood was characterized by broad spectrum abuse and neglect. He was the last
and unwanted child of a large family, and his alcoholic father repeatedly attacked and looked at
him with disgust. To make matters worse, his family imitated his father and frequently
humiliated him with heavy doses of contempt.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 81 (Number of characters: 103):
His older brother’s favorite gibe, accompanied by
a nauseated grimace, was “I can’t stand sight of you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 82 (Number of characters: 27):
You make me want to vomit!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 83 (Number of characters: 633):
Toxic shame can obliterate your self-esteem in the blink of an eye. In an emotional flashback
you can regress instantly into feeling and thinking that you are as worthless and contemptible as
your family perceived you. When you are stranded in a flashback, toxic shame devolves into the
intensely painful alienation of the abandonment mélange - a roiling morass of shame, fear and
depression. The abandonment mélange is the fear and toxic shame that surrounds and interacts with the
abandonment depression. The abandonment depression itself is the deadened feeling of
helplessness and hopelessness that afflicts traumatized children.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 84 (Number of characters: 346):
Toxic shame also inhibits us from seeking comfort and support. In a reenactment of the
childhood abandonment we are flashing back to, we often isolate ourselves and helplessly
surrender to an overwhelming feeling of humiliation. If you are stuck viewing yourself as worthless, defective, or despicable, you are probably in
an emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 85 (Number of characters: 87):
This is typically also true when you are lost in self-hate and virulent
self-criticism.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 86 (Number of characters: 280):
Immediate help for managing emotional flashbacks can be found at the beginning
of chapter 8 which lists 13 practical steps for resolving flashbacks. Numerous clients and respondents to my website tell me that the concept of emotional flashback
brings them a great sense of relief.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 87 (Number of characters: 93):
They report that for the first time they are able to make some
sense of their troubled lives.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 88 (Number of characters: 398):
A common comment has been “Now I understand why all the
psychological and spiritual approaches I have pursued had so few answers for me.” Many also
note feeling freed from a shaming list of misdiagnoses that have been given to them by
themselves or others. This in turn has aided them in ridding themselves of the self-destructive
habit of amassing evidence of their own defectiveness or craziness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 89 (Number of characters: 114):
Many also report a quantum
leap in their motivation to challenge the learned habits of self-hate and self-disgust.

Suicidal Ideation

Suicidal Ideation
Suicidal ideation is a common phenomenon in Cptsd, particularly during intense or prolonged
flashbacks. Suicidal ideation is depressed thinking or fantasizing about wanting to die. It can
range from active suicidality to passive suicidality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 93 (Number of characters: 320):
Passive suicidality is far more common with the Cptsd survivors who I have known, and it
ranges from wishing you were dead to fantasizing about ways to end your life. When lost in
suicidal ideation, the survivor may even pray to be delivered from this life, or fantasize about
being taken by some calamitous act of fate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 94 (Number of characters: 110):
He may even think or obsess - without being serious
- of stepping in front of a car or jumping off a building.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 95 (Number of characters: 689):
Fantasy typically ends, however, without a serious intent to kill yourself. This is as opposed
to active suicidality where the person is actively proceeding in the direction of taking her life. I am discussing passive suicidality because it does not merit the same kind of alarm as
active suicidality. Passive suicidality is typically a flashback to early childhood when our
abandonment was so profound, that it was natural for us to wish that God or somebody or
something would just put an end to it all. When the survivor catches himself in a suicidal reverie, he will benefit from seeing it both
as an emblem of how much pain he is in, and as a sign of a particularly intense flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 96 (Number of characters: 749):
This
then can direct him to use the flashback management steps in chapter 8. If however, flashback management does not help, and suicidality becomes increasingly
active, 
please 
call 
the 
national 
suicide 
hot-line [1-800-273-8255] 
or 
visit
www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org, because this is a flashback that you may need help
managing, and you will get good help there. Skilled therapists and caregivers learn to discriminate between active and passive suicidal
ideation, and do not panic and catastrophize when encountering the latter. Instead, the counselor
invites the survivor to explore his suicidal thoughts and feelings knowing that in most cases,
verbal ventilation of the flashback pain underneath it will deconstruct the suicidality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 97 (Number of characters: 221):
In the much less common scenario of active suicidality, encouraging verbal ventilation will
also help the therapist or helper discern if there is indeed a real risk and if action needs to be
taken to protect the survivor.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 98 (Number of characters: 143):
What You May Have Been Misdiagnosed With
I once heard renowned traumatologist, John Briere, quip that if Cptsd were ever given its due,
the DSM

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 99 (Number of characters: 174):
[The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders] used by all mental health
professionals would shrink from its dictionary like size to the size of a thin pamphlet.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 100 (Number of characters: 477):
In other
words, the role of traumatized childhoods in most adult psychological disorders is enormous. I have witnessed many clients with Cptsd misdiagnosed with various anxiety and depressive
disorders. Moreover, many are also unfairly and inaccurately labeled with bipolar, narcissistic,
codependent, autistic spectrum and borderline disorders. [This is not to say that Cptsd does not
sometimes co-occur with these disorders.] Further confusion also arises in the case of ADHD

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 101 (Number of characters: 175):
[Attention Deficit Hyperactive
Disorder], as well as obsessive/compulsive disorder, both of which are sometimes more
accurately described as fixated flight responses to trauma

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 102 (Number of characters: 21):
[see the 4F’s below].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 103 (Number of characters: 25):
This is also true

of ADD

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 104 (Number of characters: 163):
[Attention Deficit Disorder] and some depressive and dissociative disorders which
similarly can more accurately be described as fixated freeze responses to trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 105 (Number of characters: 136):
Furthermore, this is not to say that those so misdiagnosed do not have issues that are similar
and correlative with the disorders above.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 106 (Number of characters: 514):
The key point is that these labels are incomplete and
unnecessarily shaming descriptions of what the survivor is actually afflicted with. Reducing Cptsd to “panic disorder” is like calling food allergies chronically itchy eyes. Over-focusing treatment on the symptoms of panic in the former case and eye health in the latter
does little to get at root causes. Feelings of panic or itchiness in the eyes can be masked with
medication, but all the associated problems that cause these symptoms will remain untreated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 107 (Number of characters: 408):
Moreover, most of the diagnoses mentioned above are typically treated as innate
characterological defects rather than as learned maladaptations to stress – adaptations that
survivors were forced to learn as traumatized children. And, most importantly, because these
adaptations were learned, they can often be extinguished or significantly diminished, and
replaced with more functional adaptations to stress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 108 (Number of characters: 670):
In this vein, I believe that many substance and process addictions also begin as misguided,
maladaptations to parental abuse and abandonment. They are early adaptations that are attempts
to soothe and distract from the mental, emotional and physical pain of Cptsd. Origins Of Cptsd
How do traumatically abused and/or abandoned children develop Cptsd? While the origin of Cptsd is most often associated with extended periods of physical and/or
sexual abuse in childhood, my observations convince me that ongoing verbal and emotional
abuse also causes it. Many dysfunctional parents react contemptuously to a baby or toddler’s plaintive call for
connection and attachment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 109 (Number of characters: 556):
Contempt is extremely traumatizing to a child, and at best, extremely
noxious to an adult. Contempt is a toxic cocktail of verbal and emotional abuse, a deadly amalgam of
denigration, rage and disgust. Rage creates fear, and disgust creates shame in the child in a way
that soon teaches her to refrain from crying out, from ever asking for attention. Before long, the
child gives up on seeking any kind of help or connection at all. The child’s bid for bonding and
acceptance is thwarted, and she is left to suffer in the frightened despair of abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 110 (Number of characters: 377):
Particularly abusive parents deepen the abandonment trauma by linking corporal
punishment with contempt. Slaveholders and prison guards typically use contempt and scorn to
destroy their victims’ self-esteem. Slaves, prisoners, and children, who are made to feel
worthless and powerless devolve into learned helplessness and can be controlled with far less
energy and attention.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 111 (Number of characters: 148):
Cult leaders also use contempt to shrink their followers into absolute
submission after luring them in with brief phases of fake unconditional love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 112 (Number of characters: 65):
Furthermore, Cptsd can also be caused by emotional neglect alone.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 113 (Number of characters: 50):
This key theme is explored at
length in chapter 5.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 114 (Number of characters: 886):
If you notice that you are berating yourself because your trauma seems
insignificant compared to others, please skip ahead to this chapter and resume reading here upon

completion. Emotional neglect also typically underlies most traumatizations that are more glaringly
evident. Parents who routinely ignore or turn their backs on a child’s calls for attention,
connection or help, abandon their child to unmanageable amounts of fear, and the child
eventually gives up and succumbs to depressed, death-like feelings of helplessness and
hopelessness. These types of rejection simultaneously magnify the child’s fear, and eventually add a
coating of shame to it. Over time this fear and shame begets a toxic inner critic that holds the
child, and later the adult, totally responsible for his parents’ abandonment, until he becomes his
own worst enemy and descends into the bowels of Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 115 (Number of characters: 341):
More About Trauma
Trauma occurs when attack or abandonment triggers a fight/flight response so intensely that the
person cannot turn it off once the threat is over. He becomes stuck in an adrenalized state. His
sympathetic nervous system is locked “on” and he cannot toggle into the relaxation function of
the parasympathetic nervous system.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 116 (Number of characters: 93):
One common instance of this occurs when a child is attacked and hurt by a bully after
school.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 117 (Number of characters: 201):
He may remain in a hypervigilant, fearful state until someone takes action to insure him
that he will not be revictimized, and until someone helps him release the hyperactivation in his
nervous system.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 118 (Number of characters: 362):
If the child has learned through experience that he can come to at least one of his parents
when he is hurting, frightened or needing help, he will tell mom or dad about it. With them, he
will grieve the temporary death of his sense of safety in the world by verbally ventilating, crying
and angering about it [chapter 11 expands on these processes of grieving].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 119 (Number of characters: 156):
Moreover, his parent will report the bully and take steps to assure that it will not happen
again, and the child will typically be released from the trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 120 (Number of characters: 91):
He will naturally relax back into
the safety of parasympathetic nervous system functioning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 121 (Number of characters: 865):
“Simple”, one incident traumas can often be resolved relatively easily if Cptsd is not
already present. If however the bullying happens on numerous occasions and the child does not seek help, or
if the child lives in an environment so dangerous that the parent is powerless to ensure a
modicum of safety, it may take more than parental comforting to release the trauma. If the
trauma is not too continuous over too long a time, a short course of therapy may be all that is
needed to resolve the trauma, provided of course the danger in the environment can effectively
be remediated. When the trauma however is repetitive and ongoing and no help is available, the child may
become so frozen in trauma that the symptoms of “simple” ptsd begin to set in. This can also
occur during the prolonged trauma of combat or entrapment in a cult or domestic violence
situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 122 (Number of characters: 197):
If however, a person is also afflicted by ongoing family abuse or profound emotional
abandonment, the trauma will manifest as a particularly severe emotional flashback because he
already has Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 123 (Number of characters: 58):
This is particularly true when his parent is also a bully.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 124 (Number of characters: 470):
The Four F’s: Fight, Flight, Freeze And Fawn
Earlier, I mentioned the fight/flight response that is an innate automatic response to danger in all
human beings. A more complete and accurate description of this instinct is the
fight/flight/freeze/fawn response. The complex nervous system wiring of this response allows a
person in danger to react in four different ways. A fight response is triggered when a person suddenly responds aggressively to something
threatening.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 125 (Number of characters: 464):
A flight response is triggered when a person responds to a perceived threat by
fleeing, or symbolically, by launching into hyperactivity. A freeze response is triggered when a
person, realizing resistance is futile, gives up, numbs out into dissociation and/or collapses as if
accepting the inevitability of being hurt. A fawn response is triggered when a person responds to
threat by trying to be pleasing or helpful in order to appease and forestall an attacker.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 126 (Number of characters: 838):
This
fourfold response potential will heretofore be referred to as the 4Fs. Traumatized children often over-gravitate to one of these response patterns to survive, and
as time passes these four modes become elaborated into entrenched defensive structures that are
similar to narcissistic [fight], obsessive/compulsive [flight], dissociative [freeze] or codependent
[fawn] defenses. These structures help children survive their horrific childhoods, but leave them very limited
and narrow in how they respond to life. Even worse, they remain locked in these patterns in
adulthood when they no longer need to rely so heavily on one primary response pattern. It is important to understand that variances in the childhood abuse/neglect patterns, birth
order, and genetic predispositions result in people polarizing to their particular 4F type.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 127 (Number of characters: 708):
In the next section we will explore examples of how children are driven into these defenses
by traumatizing parents. The four children in the vignette below match the four basic types of
trauma survivors:
Bob=Fight - Narcissistic
Carol=Flight - Obsessive/Compulsive
Maude=Freeze - Dissociative
Sean=Fawn - Codependent
The 4F’s In A Cptsd-Inducing Family
Carol was the scapegoat of her family. Narcissistic and borderline parents typically choose at
least one child to be the designated family scapegoat. Scapegoating is the process by which a bully offloads and externalizes his pain, stress, and
frustration by attacking a less powerful person. Typically scapegoating brings the bully some
momentary relief.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 128 (Number of characters: 768):
It does not however effectively metabolize or release his pain, and
scapegoating soon resumes as the bully’s internal discomfort resurfaces. Wilhelm Reich, in his brilliant book The Psychology of Fascism, explains how scapegoating
occurs on a continuum that stretches from the persecution of the targeted child by a bullying
parent to the horrific scapegoating of the Jews by the Nazi’s. In especially dysfunctional families
like Carol’s, the scapegoating parent often organizes the rest of the family to also gang up on the
scapegoat. Carol discovered a great deal about her early childhood from watching home videos. Her
parents were so narcissistically oblivious, that they unabashedly recorded many incidents of
Carol being verbally and emotionally abused by them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 129 (Number of characters: 112):
This was usually in the background of
recordings of the performances of their favorite child, her older brother.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 130 (Number of characters: 223):
Severely narcissistic
parents are rarely embarrassed by their aggressive behavior. They feel entitled to punish a child
for anything that displeases them, no matter how unreasonable it might appear to an impartial
observer.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 131 (Number of characters: 115):
Carols’ parents started in on her early by disdainfully blaming her for soiling her diaper
before she was even one.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 132 (Number of characters: 201):
By the time she was three, she had been so frequently punished for
making noise while talking and playfully exploring her house, that her constant state of fear
generated an ADHD-like condition in her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 133 (Number of characters: 210):
Carol’s large backyard was her refuge where she would play with great gusto - climbing,
running, cavorting, and building and ransacking villages that she made with her toys and leaves,
grass, sticks and stones.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 134 (Number of characters: 192):
She would busy herself from breakfast until supper, often forgetting to
come in for lunch, which she thought in retrospect made life even easier for her mother, who
never called her in to eat.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 135 (Number of characters: 308):
One family video from this time was the straw that broke the camel’s back of Carol’s denial
that her family was abusive. It showed her playing a game whereby she would repetitively smack
herself hard on the hand and call herself a bad girl as she wobbled around the living room
touching various knick-knacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 136 (Number of characters: 545):
There was a considerable amount of footage that showed her
parents and siblings roaring with mocking delight in the background. When contempt replaces the milk of human kindness at an early age, the child feels
humiliated and overwhelmed. Too helpless to protest or even understand the unfairness of being
abused, the child eventually becomes convinced that she is defective and fatally flawed. Frequently she comes to believe that she deserves her parents’ persecution. When Carol was four, she “accidentally” fell out of a second story window.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 137 (Number of characters: 309):
A few years
later, she stepped out into the street in front of a car and was knocked to the ground. As an adult,
she was convinced that both injuries contributed to her extremely painful, early onset scoliosis. She also believed that she was in so much pain, that she was unconsciously trying to end her life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 138 (Number of characters: 71):
Fortunately for Carol, school eventually offered a glimmer of reprieve.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 139 (Number of characters: 122):
A kindly third grade
teacher perceived her intelligence, and praised her enough that she soon became an excellent
student.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 140 (Number of characters: 127):
Unfortunately, the terrible anxiety that she lived with 24/7 soon morphed into an
obsessive/compulsive approach to school work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 141 (Number of characters: 83):
This, in turn, later manifested into a life-spoiling
perfectionism and workaholism.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 142 (Number of characters: 403):
Carol’s older brother, Bob, the favorite and hero of her parents was not molded with fear
and rejection like Carol. Bob, the recipient of the parents’ narcissistic expectations, was shaped
into a multidimensional achiever by their withdrawal of approval for less than perfect
performances. He was then given tidbits of praise for outstanding accomplishments that would
reflect positively on his parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 143 (Number of characters: 557):
He was also enlisted to further scapegoat Carol, and as time
went on outdid his parents in tormenting her. I believe there is an epidemic of sibling abuse that afflicts many dysfunctional families. Siblings in such families can traumatize the victim-scapegoat as severely as the parents. In
families with checked out, disinterested parents, they can in fact be the chief sources of trauma. This is especially true in our culture where emotional neglect of children is rampant and where
parents are routinely advised to let the kids “work it out themselves.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 144 (Number of characters: 150):
But how does a child who

has half the strength of his older sibling work it out, and stop him from tormenting her without
the aid of a stronger ally?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 145 (Number of characters: 565):
Bob, himself, did not escape the pathological influence of his parents. Scapegoating became
a habit for him, and he developed the narcissist’s sixth sense for identifying others whose
families had victimized and used them as targets. Bob, hurting from his parents using him and
holding him to perfectionistic standards, grew up to become a full-fledged narcissist and
“control-freak”. He aggressively tried to mold his “loved” ones as he had been molded, and was
working on whipping his fourth wife into shape at the time of Carol’s therapy. Let us return to Carol.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 146 (Number of characters: 470):
As an adolescent, her trauma was painfully reinforced by her
surrounding community who so admired her brother’s accomplishments, that they joined the
family in pathologizing Carol as a “bad seed”. Unfortunately things deteriorated further for Carol as an adult, even though she had
seemingly escaped from the family. Carol remained symbolically enthralled to the family by
getting ensnared with narcissistic people who were just as abusive and neglectful as her parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 147 (Number of characters: 142):
This well known psychological phenomenon is called repetition compulsion or reenactment, and
trauma survivors are extremely susceptible to it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 148 (Number of characters: 53):
We will explore this extensively throughout the
book.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 149 (Number of characters: 301):
A third child, Maude, was born two years after Carol. By this time, her parents were worn
out from incessantly molding Bob and Carol. Having whipped Bob and Carol into hero- and
scapegoat-shape, they had little use for Maude. They did not have enough energy or interest left
to whip her into anything.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 150 (Number of characters: 77):
Maude became the classic lost child and was left on her own to raise herself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 151 (Number of characters: 566):
She soon
discovered food and daydreaming as her sole sources of comfort. However, because Bob also
enjoyed using her for target practice, she stayed in her room as much as possible. In retrospect, Carol also thought that Bob was molesting Maude. She hypothesized that
these two factors contributed to the fact that Maude could not tolerate the various nurseries and
pre-schools in which her mother tried to dump her. Over time, Maude numbed out into a low
grade dissociative depression, and felt extremely anxious and avoidant whenever she was in a
social situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 152 (Number of characters: 667):
At four, an eccentric aunt gave Maude a television for her room and she was soon
entranced. She was forced to develop an attachment disorder in which she bonded with TV rather
than with a human being. Sadly, she is still lost in that relationship living on disability in an
apartment cluttered with an enormous amount of useless hoarded material. Poor Parenting Creates Pathological Sibling Rivalry
Like many children in Cptsd-engendering families, Maude could not turn to her siblings for
comfort because her parents unconsciously practiced the “divide and conquer” principle. Her
parents modeled and encouraged sarcasm and constant fault finding among the children.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 153 (Number of characters: 364):
Moreover, interactions of cooperation or warmth were routinely ridiculed. Sibling rivalry is further reinforced in dysfunctional families by the fact that all the children
are subsisting on minimal nurturance, and are therefore without resources to give to each other. Moreover, competition for the little their parents have to give creates even fiercer rivalries.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 154 (Number of characters: 31):
Two years later, Sean was born.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 155 (Number of characters: 212):
At first, it seemed as if he was destined for the same lost,

dissociated destiny as Maude, but as he matured he fell into the role of “gifted child” as
described by Alice Miller in The Drama of the Gifted Child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 156 (Number of characters: 175):
Sean’s inborn gift coming into this life was his compassion and his sense that if he studied
his mother enough and figured out what she needed, he could provide for her needs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 157 (Number of characters: 493):
This would
sometimes calm her down and make her less dangerous, bitter and sarcastic. Over the years Sean honed this skill and could almost clairvoyantly anticipate her sore
spots, moods and preferences. Sometimes it seemed he knew what she needed before she did,
and with practice he became adept at defusing her anger and sometimes even gaining morsels of
her approval. Synchronistically, his mother realized she was getting old and that her alcohol-ravaged
husband would likely precede her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 158 (Number of characters: 133):
Not wanting to be alone, she exploited his compassionate
nature and primed him for domestic service for as long as she would need it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 159 (Number of characters: 118):
Sean remained
living at home until his mother’s death released him from emotional captivity at the age of
twenty-nine.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 160 (Number of characters: 71):
This was the codependent enslavement we will explore more in chapter 7.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 161 (Number of characters: 113):
A friend of Sean’s who knew all the siblings as adults, marveled that it seemed as if each
had different parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 162 (Number of characters: 128):
Finally, it is also important to note that the scapegoat role does not fall exclusively on the
flight type as it did with Carol.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 163 (Number of characters: 75):
It can be bestowed on anyone of the 4F types depending on the
given family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 164 (Number of characters: 134):
The scapegoating role can also shift over time from one person to another and each
parent or sibling may choose a different scapegoat.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 165 (Number of characters: 568):
Chapters 6 and 7 explore each of the 4F’s and their corresponding defensive structures in
greater detail. These chapters will also help you determine your key 4F defense, and help you
address issues that are more specific to your type of Cptsd.

LEVELS OF RECOVERING
Healing from Complex PTSD is, above all, complex. This is important to emphasize because
there are numerous one dimensional approaches to trauma that bill themselves as cure-alls. In my
opinion, however, singular approaches are unable to address all the levels of wounding that
combine to cause Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 166 (Number of characters: 126):
Moreover, working with simplistic approaches can leave you stranded in toxic shame when
you do not achieve the touted results.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 167 (Number of characters: 163):
I was motivated to write this book in large part because of
the many times I sank into new levels of self-contempt when the latest panacea therapy did not
cure me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 168 (Number of characters: 96):
I will use the word “key” repeatedly to describe the various tasks upon which recovering
hinges.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 169 (Number of characters: 437):
This book offers a keychain of perspectives and techniques to unlock yourself from being
what Alice Miller called a “Prisoner of Childhood.” Abusive and abandoning parents can injure and abandon us on many levels: cognitive,
emotional, spiritual, physical and relational. To recover, you need to learn how to support
yourself – to meet your unmet developmental needs on each level that is relevant to your
experience of childhood trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 170 (Number of characters: 78):
This chapter is a brief overview of the many tasks involved in Cptsd recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 171 (Number of characters: 319):
These tasks
are explored at greater length in Part II. The comprehensive Table of Contents at the beginning
of this book will direct you to further information on each of the topics covered in this chapter. Please allow yourself to also use the Table of Contents to explore sections of the book that peak
your interest.

chunk 172 (Number of characters: 127):
Key Developmental Arrests In Cptsd
What follows is a list of some of the most common developmental arrests that occur in Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 173 (Number of characters: 105):
You may find that you experience a diminishment or absence of these key features of healthy

human being.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 174 (Number of characters: 85):
Typically, survivors will vary on which and how many of these arrests relate to
them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 175 (Number of characters: 156):
Factors affecting this are your 4F type, your childhood abuse/ neglect pattern, your innate
nature and any recovery work that you have already accomplished.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 176 (Number of characters: 406):
Self-acceptance
Clear sense of identity
Self-Compassion
Self-Protection
Capacity to draw comfort from relationship
Ability to relax
Capacity for full self-expression
Willpower & Motivation
Peace of mind
Self-care
Belief that life is a gift
Self-esteem
Self-confidence
My efforts to nurture myself in these arrested areas of development were limited and spoiled in
early recovery by a feeling of resentment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 177 (Number of characters: 263):
“Why do I have to do this?” was a common internal
refrain. Resentment that should have been directed toward my parents often boomeranged onto
me and spoiled or thwarted my efforts at self-nurturance. Thankfully ongoing recovery work helped remedy this resentment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 178 (Number of characters: 112):
It taught me to practice
self-care in a spirit of giving to a child who needed and really deserved to be helped.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 179 (Number of characters: 585):
I find it helpful to approach developmental arrests from the viewpoint of novelist David
Mitchell’s quip that “…fire is the sun unwinding itself out of the wood”. Similarly, effective
recovery is unwinding the natural potential you were born with out of your unconscious. This is
your innate potential which may be, as yet, unrealized because of your childhood trauma. An especially tragic developmental arrest that afflicts many survivors is the loss of their
will power and self-motivation. Many dysfunctional parents react destructively to their child’s
budding sense of initiative.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 180 (Number of characters: 308):
If this occurs throughout his childhood, the survivor may feel lost
and purposeless in his life. He may drift through his whole life rudderless and without a motor. Moreover, even when he manages to identify a goal of his own choosing, he may struggle
to follow through with extended and concentrated effort.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 181 (Number of characters: 245):
Remedying this developmental arrest is
essential because many new psychological studies now show that persistence – even more than
intelligence or innate talent - is the key psychological characteristic necessary for finding
fulfillment in life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 182 (Number of characters: 317):
I have worked with many survivors stranded in this form of adult helplessness. Those who
recover from it typically do so by engaging extensively in the angering work of grieving that is
discussed throughout this book. The ability to invoke willpower seems to be allied to your ability
to healthily express your anger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 183 (Number of characters: 72):
With sufficient recovering, you can learn to manufacture your

volition.

The first level of recovery usually involves repairing the damage that Cptsd wreaks on our
thoughts and beliefs about ourselves. Cognitive recovery work aims to make your brain user friendly. It focuses on recognizing
and eliminating the destructive thoughts and thinking processes you were indoctrinated with in
childhood. Cognitive healing also depends on learning to choose healthy and more accurate ways of
talking to and thinking about yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 196 (Number of characters: 91):
On the broadest level, this involves upgrading the story
you tell yourself about your pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 197 (Number of characters: 490):
We need to understand exactly how appalling parenting created the now self-perpetuating
trauma that we live in. We can learn to do this in a way that takes the mountain of unfair self-
blame off ourselves. We can redirect this blame to our parents’ dreadful child-rearing practices. And we can also do this in a way that motivates us to reject their influence so that we can freely
orchestrate our journey of recovering. This work then requires us to build a fierce allegiance to ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 198 (Number of characters: 141):
Such loyalty strengthens
us for the cognitive work of freeing our brains from being conditioned to attack so many normal
parts of our selves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 199 (Number of characters: 124):
Cognitive work is fundamental to helping you disidentify from the self-hating critic with

As I am writing this, my son’s friend synchronistically tells
him: “This Lego creature I made spreads brain attack and eats away at the person.” I marvel at
this synchronicity and think: “What a fitting image for the trauma-inducing parent”. Shrinking The Critic
Early abuse and abandonment forces the child to merge his identity with the superego, the part of

the child’s brain that learns the rules of his caretakers in order to get and maintain acceptance. However, because acceptance is impossible in the Cptsd-engendering family, the superego gets
stuck working overtime to achieve the impossible. Perseverating on finding a formula to win
over her parents, the child eventually embraces perfectionism as a strategy to make her parents
less dangerous and more engaging.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 201 (Number of characters: 485):
Her one hope is that if she becomes smart, helpful, pretty,
and flawless enough, her parents will finally care for her. Sadly, continued failure at winning their regard forces her to conclude that she is fatally
flawed. She is loveless not because of her mistakes, but because she is a mistake. She can only
see what is wrong with or missing in her. Anything she does, says, thinks, imagines or feels has the potential to spiral her down into a
depressed abyss of fear and toxic shame.

chunk 208 (Number of characters: 509):
Chapters 9 and 10 focus extensively on practical tools for shrinking your critic. The Developmentally Arrested Healthy Ego
Over time the critic becomes more and more synonymous with the survivor’s identity. The
superego morphs into a totalitarian critic that trumps the development of a healthy ego. [The ego
develops later than the superego.]
“Ego”, contrary to popular usage, is not a dirty word. In psychology, the term ego
represents what we typically mean when we use terms like my “self” or my identity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 209 (Number of characters: 477):
The healthy
ego is the user friendly manager of the psyche. Unfortunately, Cptsd-inducing parents thwart the
growth of the ego by undermining the development of the crucial egoic processes of self-
compassion and self-protection. They do this by shaming or intimidating you whenever you have a natural impulse to have
sympathy for yourself, or stand up for yourself. The instinct to care for yourself and to protect
yourself against unfairness is then forced to become dormant.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 210 (Number of characters: 175):
Psychoeducation And Cognitive Healing
Becoming psychoeducated about Cptsd is the first level of addressing this poisonous

you know what to fix. This is essential because without a properly functioning ego, you have no center for making

trouble or getting abandoned, rather than on the principles of having meaningful and equitable

interactions with the world.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 214 (Number of characters: 170):
You can learn to gradually replace the critic’s toxic perspective with a viewpoint that

You are free now as an adult to develop peace of mind and a supportive relationship with
yourself. A self-championing stance can transform your existence from struggling survival to a

awaken and bloom in your life. Cognitive healing may have begun or been reinforced by reading what has preceded this. Hopefully you are having some epiphanies about what is at the core of your suffering.

chunk 216 (Number of characters: 165):
Some readers may have been searching for cognitive answers for years, and through their

chunk 220 (Number of characters: 397):
They are especially limited in addressing emotional issues, as we
will see below. In early recovery, the psychoeducation piece of cognitive work typically comes from the wisdom
of others: teachers, writers, friends and therapists who are more informed on this subject than we
are. When psychoeducation reaches its most powerful level of effectiveness, however, it begins
to morph into mindfulness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 221 (Number of characters: 190):
MINDFULNESS
Psychologically speaking, mindfulness is taking undistracted time to become fully aware of your
thoughts and feelings so that you can have more choice in how you respond to them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 222 (Number of characters: 80):
Do I really
agree with this thought, or have I been pressured into believing it?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 223 (Number of characters: 562):
How do I want to respond to
this feeling – distract myself from it, repress it, express it or just feel it until it changes into
something else? Mindfulness is a perspective that weds your capacity for self-observation with your instinct
of self-compassion. It is therefore your ability to observe yourself from an objective and self-
accepting viewpoint. It is a key function of a healthily developed ego and is sometimes described
as the observing ego or the witnessing self. Mindfulness is a perspective of benign curiosity about all of your inner experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 224 (Number of characters: 86):
Recovery is enhanced immeasurably by developing this helpful process of introspection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 225 (Number of characters: 160):
As it
becomes more developed, mindfulness can be used to recognize and dis-identify from beliefs and
viewpoints that you acquired from your traumatizing family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 226 (Number of characters: 713):
I cannot overstate the importance of becoming aware of your inner self-commentary. With
enough practice, mindfulness eventually awakens your fighting spirit to resist the abusive
refrains from your childhood, and to replace them with thoughts that are self-supportive. Mindfulness also helps you to establish a perspective from which you can assess and guide your
own efforts of recovering. Chapter 12 contains detailed instruction for enhancing mindfulness, as do the writings of
Steven Levine, Jack Kornfield and John Kabat-Zinn. Finally, it is important to note that mindfulness tends to develop and expand in a progressive
manner to all levels of our experience, cognitive, emotional, physical and relational.

Mindfulness
is essential for guiding us at every level of recovering, and we will examine this principle more

EMOTIONAL HEALING
Traumatizing parents do as much damage to our emotional natures as they do to our thinking
processes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 229 (Number of characters: 89):
Consequently, there is a great deal of recovery work that needs to be done on this
level.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 230 (Number of characters: 828):
This is especially true because of the damage our wider society also does to our emotional
natures. Recovering The Emotional Nature
This section is an updated version of an article I wrote in 1991. I originally wrote it as a prelude
to my first book, The Tao of Fully Feeling, and it was written as an appeal to the general public
to understand the consequences of trying to sanitize one’s emotions. Thankfully, the response I
received encouraged me to complete that book, which is a guide to overcoming the familial and
societal damage meted out on children’s emotional life. The survivor, who is seeking a healthy relationship with his emotional being, will strive to
accept the existential fact that the human feeling nature is often contradictory and frequently
vacillates between opposite polarities of feeling experiences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 231 (Number of characters: 721):
It is quite normal for feelings to
change unpredictably along continuums that stretch between a variety of emotional polarities. As
such, it is especially human and healthy to have shifts of mood between such extremes as happy
and sad, enthused and depressed, loving and angry, trusting and suspicious, brave and afraid, and
forgiving and blaming. Unfortunately, in this culture only the “positive” polarity of any emotional experience is
approved or allowed. This can cause such an avoidance of the “negative” polarity, that at least
two different painful conditions result. In the first, the person injures and exhausts himself in compulsive attempts to avoid a
disavowed feeling, and actually becomes more stuck in it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 232 (Number of characters: 141):
This is like the archetypal clown
whose frantic efforts to free himself from a piece of fly paper, leave him more immobilized and

entangled.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 233 (Number of characters: 160):
In the second, repression of one end of the emotional continuum often leads to a repression
of the whole continuum, and the person becomes emotionally deadened.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 234 (Number of characters: 93):
The baby of emotional
vitality is thrown out with the bathwater of some unacceptable feeling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 235 (Number of characters: 113):
A reluctance to participate in such a fundamental realm of the human experience results in
much unnecessary loss.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 236 (Number of characters: 1002):
For just as without night there is no day, without work there is no play,
without hunger there is no satiation, without fear there is no courage, without tears there is no
joy, and without anger, there is no real love. Most people, who choose or are coerced into only identifying with “positive” feelings,
usually wind up in an emotionally lifeless middle ground – bland, deadened, and dissociated in
an unemotional “no-man’s-land.” Moreover, when a person tries to hold onto a preferred feeling for longer than its actual
tenure, she often appears as unnatural and phony as ersatz grass or plastic flowers. If instead, she
learns to surrender willingly to the normal human experience that good feelings always ebb and
flow, she will eventually be graced with a growing ability to renew herself in the vital waters of
emotional flexibility. The repression of the so-called negative polarities of emotion causes much unnecessary
pain, as well as the loss of many essential aspects of the feeling nature.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 237 (Number of characters: 763):
In fact, much of the
plethora of loneliness, alienation, and addictive distraction that plagues modern industrial
societies is a result of people being taught and forced to reject, pathologize or punish so many of
their own and others’ normal feeling states. Nowhere, not in the deepest recesses of the self, or in the presence of his closest friends, is
the average person allowed to have and explore any number of normal emotional states. Anger,
depression, envy, sadness, fear, distrust, etc., are all as normal a part of life as bread and flowers
and streets. Yet, they have become ubiquitously avoided and shameful human experiences. How tragic this is, for all of these emotions have enormously important and healthy
functions in a wholly integrated psyche.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 238 (Number of characters: 730):
One dimension where this is most true is in the arena of
healthy self-protection. For without access to our uncomfortable or painful feelings, we are
deprived of the most fundamental part of our ability to notice when something is unfair, abusive,
or neglectful in our environments. Those who cannot feel their sadness often do not know when they are being unfairly
excluded, and those who cannot feel their normal angry or fearful responses to abuse, are often in
danger of putting up with it without protest. Perhaps never before has humankind been so alienated from so many of its normal feeling
states, as it is in the twenty-first century. Never before have so many human beings been so
emotionally deadened and impoverished.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 239 (Number of characters: 905):
The disease of emotional emaciation is epidemic. Its effects on health are often
euphemistically labeled as stress, and like the emotions, stress is often treated like some
unwanted waste that must be removed. Until all of the emotions are accepted indiscriminately (and acceptance does not imply
license to dump emotions irresponsibly or abusively), there can be no wholeness, no real sense of
well being, and no solid sense of self esteem. Thus, while it may be fairly easy to like yourself
when feelings of love or happiness or serenity are present, deeper psychological health is seen
only when you can maintain a posture of self-love and self-respect in the times of emotional hurt
that accompany life’s inevitable contingencies of loss, loneliness, confusion, uncontrollable

unfairness, and accidental mistake. The human feeling experience, much like the weather, is often unpredictably changeable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 240 (Number of characters: 973):
No “positive” feeling can be induced to persist as a permanent experience, no matter what
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy tells us. As disappointing as this may be, as much as we might
like to deny it, as much as it causes each of us ongoing life frustration, and as much as we were
raised and continue to be reinforced for trying to control and pick our feelings, they are still by
definition of the human condition, largely outside the province of our wills. EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE
Daniel Goleman defines emotional intelligence as our ability to successfully recognize and
manage our own feelings and to healthily respond to the feelings of others. As implied above, I
believe the quality of our emotional intelligence is reflected in the degree to which we accept all
of our feelings without automatically dissociating from them or expressing them in a way that
hurts ourselves or others. When we are emotionally intelligent we also extend this acceptance to
our intimates.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 241 (Number of characters: 665):
One of my clients calls this the hallmark of “relationships.”
Another way of saying this is that I have self-esteem to the degree that I keep my heart open
to myself in all my emotional states. And, I have intimacy when my friend and I offer this type
of emotional acceptance to each other. Once again, this does not condone destructive expressions
of anger which are, of course, counterproductive to trust and intimacy. Cptsd-engendering parents often hypocritically attack their children’s emotional expression in a
bi-modal way. This occurs when the child is both abused for emoting and is, at the same time,
abused by her caretaker’s toxic emotional expression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 242 (Number of characters: 558):
Most traumatizing parents are especially contemptuous towards the child’s expression of
emotional pain. This contempt then forces the child’s all-important capacity for healthy grieving
into developmental arrest. One archetypal example of this is seen in the parent who hurts his child to the point of tears,
and then has the nerve to say: “Stop crying or I’ll give you something to cry about!” A client
once told me that he often fantasized about giving his father this angry reply: “What are you
talking about, you already gave me something to cry about?!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 243 (Number of characters: 145):
He did not, however, because he
had long since learned that getting angry back was a capital crime that would elicit the most
savage retaliation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 244 (Number of characters: 489):
Typically it would be delivered with homicidal rage: “I’ll knock you from
here to Kingdom come!” The above is of course a blatant example of the slaughtering of emotional expression. Just
as common is the insidious, passive-aggressive assault on emoting which is seen in the parent
who shuns her child for expressing his feelings. This is seen in the emotionally abandoning
parent who sequesters the child in a timeout for crying, or routinely retreats from the crying child
into her room.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 245 (Number of characters: 102):
The worst, most damaging example of this occurs when this is done to the pre-verbal
toddler [or baby!]

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 246 (Number of characters: 52):
who only has emotions with which to express herself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 247 (Number of characters: 989):
Pre-verbal children are
by definition far too young to learn the 2-3 year-olds’ developmental task of using her words to

communicate about her feelings. An especially nasty form of emotional abuse occurs in the traumatizing family when the child is
even attacked for displays of pleasant emotion. As I write this I flashback to scenes of my mother
sneering at my little sister and snarling: “What are you so happy about!”, and my father’s
frequent: “What are you laughing at – wipe that smile off your face!”
Emotional abuse is also almost always also accompanied by emotional abandonment, which can
most simply be described as a relentless lack of parental warmth and love. Sometimes this is
most poignantly described as not being liked by your parents, which belies the many Cptsd-
inducing parents who say they love their children, but demonstrate in a thousand ways that they
do not like them. “The sight of you makes me sick” was very popular with such parents when I
was growing up.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 248 (Number of characters: 731):
It can still bring tears to my eyes to remember my emotionally abandoned young sister
secreted in a corner of the house begging our family dog: “Like me, Ginger, Like me!” Toxic Shame And Soul Murder
The rejecting responses of our parents to our emotional expression alienate us from our feelings. Emotional abuse/neglect scares us out of our own emotions while simultaneously making us
terrified of other people’s feelings. John Bradshaw describes the devastation of the child’s emotional nature as “soul murder”. He explains this as involving a process where the child’s emotional expression [his first language
of self-expression] is so assaulted with disgust that any emotional experience immediately
devolves into toxic shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 249 (Number of characters: 744):
I believe that toxic shame is the affect of the inner critic, and that inner critic thought-
processes are the cognitions of shame – a terrible yin/yang process emanating from our original
abandonment. Because of the deadly one-two punch of familial and societal attacks on our emotional selves, we
need to recover our innate emotional intelligence. This is also deeply important because, as Carl
Jung emphasized, our emotions tell us what is really important to us. When our emotional
intelligence is restricted, we often do not know what we really want, and can consequently
struggle mightily with even the smallest decisions. As emotional recovery progresses, the mindfulness described above begins to extend
toward our emotional experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 250 (Number of characters: 556):
This helps us to stop automatically dissociating from our
feelings. We then learn to identify our feelings and choose healthy ways to respond to them and
from them. Such emotional development illuminates our own natural preferences, and, in turn

aids us in making easier and better choices. Towards the end of a long term therapy, a male client told me: “Yesterday, I was
contemplating what I have discovered in the years of our work together, and I’m amazed at how
much my values have shifted away from those of the macho family and culture I grew up in.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 251 (Number of characters: 557):
I
feel now like I prefer the arts to science, novels to non-fiction, gardening to watching golf, and
hanging out with my partner at home to partying at the bar.” Grieving As Emotional Intelligence
Grieving is the key process for reconnecting with our repressed emotional intelligence. Grieving
reconnects us with our full complement of feelings. Grieving is necessary to help us release and
work through our pain about the terrible losses of our childhoods. These losses are like deaths of
parts of our selves, and grieving can often initiate their rebirth.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 252 (Number of characters: 176):
Grieving And Verbal Ventilation
Grieving restores our crucial, developmentally arrested capacity to verbally ventilate. Verbal
ventilation is the penultimate grieving practice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 253 (Number of characters: 94):
It is speaking from your feelings in a way that
releases and resolves your emotional distress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 254 (Number of characters: 606):
I believe the following description of a six panel cartoon visually conveys the powerful
transformative power of verbal ventilation. In the first panel of the wordless cartoon, a woman
with a dark cloud over her head is talking to a friend who has a shining sun over hers. In panel
two, as the first woman gestures in a way that indicates complaining, the cloud covers her
friend’s sun. In panel three, the cloud emits a bolt of lightning, as she angrily purges, and her
friend glowers along with her. In panel four, the cloud rains on them as they embrace,
commiserating in the rain of their shared tears.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 255 (Number of characters: 435):
In panel 5, relief spreads over their faces as the
cloud moves away from the sun. In panel 6 the sun shines over both of them, as they smile and
slip into pleasant conversation. This cartoon reflects the fully realized power of verbal ventilation, which is the key bonding
process in intimacy. It is also the key healing process of effective therapy, and here is an
example of what verbally ventilating looks like in a therapy session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 256 (Number of characters: 41):
A client arrives flashbacked and in pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 257 (Number of characters: 431):
He verbally ventilates about it. He is the regressed
hurt child, feeling bad, and part of him is sad and part of him is mad. He is once again lost in the
painful feelings of his original abandonment, and this state is like a death that responds well to
grieving. As he lets his feelings come into his voice, he talks, cries and angers out his pain. Through
this processing of his pain, he then gradually moves out of his flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 258 (Number of characters: 490):
He is restored to his
normal everyday sense that he is no longer trapped in his traumatic childhood. Relief about this
returns him to his normal ability to cope. If his grieving is deep enough, he customarily feels
more hopeful and lighthearted. Not infrequently, his sense of humor resurfaces, and laughter
punctuates his continuing verbal ventilation. This laughter is usually much different than the
sarcastic, self-bullying humor of his critic that he might have begun the session with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 259 (Number of characters: 815):
The inner critic is sometimes so hostile to grieving that shrinking the critic may need to be your
first recovery priority. Until the critic is sufficiently tamed, grieving can actually make
flashbacks worse, rather than perform the restorative processes it alone can initiate. I have worked with numerous clients who were so traumatized around grieving that we
needed to spend many months working on the cognitive level before grieving was released from
the spoiling effects of the toxic critic. Chapter 11 provides a great deal of practical guidance for
restoring your ability to grieve. SPIRITUAL HEALING
Soothing Abandonment Losses Via A Higher Sense Of Belonging
Spiritual beliefs are of course a subject of personal and sometimes private concern, and I believe
and hope what I write here is not proselytizing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 260 (Number of characters: 99):
My aim, instead, is to point out psychological
concepts that have a non-sectarian spiritual aspect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 261 (Number of characters: 201):
I am aware, however, that some survivors
have suffered terrible spiritual abuse in childhood, and if the term “spiritual” is offensive or
triggering in any way, please feel free to bypass this section.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 262 (Number of characters: 50):
There are many other useful tools in
this toolbox.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 263 (Number of characters: 434):
A key aspect of the abandonment depression in Cptsd is the lack of a sense of belonging to
humanity, life, anyone or anything. I have met many survivors whose first glimmer of
“belonging” came to them on a quest that began as a spiritual pursuit. Finding nothing but
betrayal in the realm of humans, they turned to the spiritual for help. Spiritual pursuits are sometimes fueled by an unconscious hope of finding a sense of
belonging.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 264 (Number of characters: 582):
The worst thing that can happen to a child is to be unwelcomed in his family of origin
- to never feel included. Moreover, many survivors have little or no experience of any social
arena that feels safe and welcoming. Many survivors also do not find a sense of belonging in traditional or organized religions. Finding conventional religion too reminiscent of their dysfunctional families, some survivors
look to more solitary spiritual approaches. They find a sense of belonging to something larger
and more comforting by reading spiritual books or engaging in meditative practices.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 265 (Number of characters: 67):
This also
allows them to bypass the danger of direct human contact.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 266 (Number of characters: 706):
Other survivors have spiritual experiences of belonging to something greater and
worthwhile by being in nature, by listening to music or by appreciating the arts. I once marveled
at a book, whose title now eludes me, that was a compendium of quotes from many renowned
people who had numinous experiences through the direct perception of nature’s beauty. A numinous experience is a powerful moving feeling of well being accompanied by a sense
that there is a positive, benign force behind the universe, as well as within yourself. This in turn
sometimes brings enough grace with it, that you have a profound feeling that you are essentially
worthwhile, that you belong in this life, and that life is a gift.

I wrapped my arms around myself and felt the

sense. I realized that all the life experiences I have had to date brought me to that exact moment

gentle wave and for a few moments I felt a connection to a feeling of everything being part of
life.

“The gratitude feeling is deep and profound when it occurs. It feels like a moment of
connection to life itself on the deepest level and all life circumstances and what I deem as
problems pale to insignificance in those moments and there is only love in its purest form. It
truly feels like a blessing albeit fleeting but gives enough sustenance and hope to continue the
journey.” Whatever the source, spiritual or numinous occurrences sometimes provide the survivor
with her first sense of belonging to something bigger and essentially good. Such experiences can
lead a survivor to an author or speaker or fellow traveler with similar sensibilities, and
sometimes a door opens for finding comfort with a fellow human.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 280 (Number of characters: 740):
Eventually, this may even
grow into a sense that there are some humans out there who are good and safe enough to engage
with. Gratitude And Good Enough Parenting
When developing children receive “good enough parenting”, they feel that life is a gift even
though it typically comes with difficult and painful experiences. The term good enough parenting derives from the work of renowned adult and child
psychologist, D.W. Winnicott, who coined the term “good enough mothering” to describe his
observation that children do not need parents to be perfect. He noticed through his long career
that children grew up with their self-esteem and capacity for intimacy intact when their parents
were reasonably consistent with their love and support.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 281 (Number of characters: 112):
Nowadays, many therapists attach the phrase “good enough” to concepts like friend,
partner, therapist or person.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 282 (Number of characters: 543):
This is usually done to deconstruct perfectionistic expectations of
relationships - expectations that are so unrealistic that they are destructive to essentially
worthwhile relationships. When I apply the concept of “good enough” to people, I generally mean that a person is
essentially good hearted, tries to be fair, and meets his or her commitments a large portion of the
time. I also like to apply “good enough” to other concepts such as a good enough job, a good

enough try, a good enough outing, a good enough day or a good enough life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 283 (Number of characters: 181):
I apply this concept
liberally to contradict the black-and-white, all-or none thinking of the critic which reflexively
judges people and things as defective unless they are perfect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 284 (Number of characters: 279):
Good enough parents provide generous amounts of support, protection and comforting. They
also guide their children to deal constructively with recurring existential difficulties such as loss,
real villains, painful world events and normal disappointments with friends and family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 285 (Number of characters: 618):
Most importantly, they model how disappointments with intimates can be repaired. A key
way they do this is to easily forgive their children for normal mistakes and shortcomings. Children who receive good enough parenting easily recognize and protect themselves from
bullying and exploitive people because they do not have to become accustomed to being treated
unfairly. Growing up in a safe and loving enough family naturally enhances the child’s capacity to
notice and enjoy the many gifts that life also brings. He learns that there is enough good in life to
significantly outweigh its necessary losses and travails.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 286 (Number of characters: 125):
In the traumatizing family however, there is little or nothing that is good enough and hence
little for which to be grateful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 287 (Number of characters: 524):
The child instead is forced to over-develop a critic that hyper-
focuses on what is dangerously imperfect in her as well as others. This sometimes helps her to
hide aspects of herself that might be punished. It may further assist her to avoid people who
might be punishing. Unfortunately, years of this habituates the child into only seeing herself, life and others in a
negative light. Consequently, when she grows up and becomes free of her truly harmful family,
she cannot see that life offers her many new possibilities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 288 (Number of characters: 165):
Her ability to see the good in herself
and certain safe enough others remains developmentally arrested. The cultivation of gratitude requires a balanced perspective.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 289 (Number of characters: 150):
You can learn to see and
appreciate the good in life without giving up your ability to discern what is truly negative and
unacceptable in the present.

chunk 290 (Number of characters: 1274):
SOMATIC HEALING
Trauma takes its toll on the body in many ways. We need to comprehend the physical damage
that Cptsd wreaks on our bodies to motivate us to adopt practices that help us to heal on this
level. Most of the physiological damage of extended trauma occurs because we are forced to
spend so much time in hyper-arousal – stuck in fight, flight, freeze or fawn mode. When we are chronically stressed out [stuck in sympathetic nervous system activation],
detrimental somatic changes become ingrained in our bodies. Here are some of the most
common examples of body-harming reactions to Cptsd stress:
Hypervigilance
Shallow and Incomplete Breathing
Constant Adrenalization

Armoring, i.e., Chronic muscle tightness
Wear and tear from rushing and armoring
Inability to be fully present, relaxed and grounded in our bodies
Sleep problems from being over-activated
Digestive disorders from a tightened digestive tract
Physiological damage from excessive self-medication with alcohol, food or drugs
Moreover, in cases of physical and sexual abuse, our capacities to be physically comforted by
touch are eliminated or compromised; and, in cases of verbal and emotional abuse, our capacities
to be comforted by eye- and voice-contact are undeveloped or seriously diminished.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 291 (Number of characters: 161):
Somatic Self-Help
The good news is that some somatic repair happens automatically when we reduce our
physiological stress by more efficient flashback management.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 292 (Number of characters: 152):
Particularly potent help also comes
from the grieving work of reclaiming the ability to cry self-compassionately and to express anger
self-protectively.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 293 (Number of characters: 143):
Both processes can release armoring, promote embodiment, improve sleep,
decrease hyperarousal and encourage deeper and more rhythmic breathing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 294 (Number of characters: 109):
Without further expressly somatic work, however, a full relaxed inhabitancy of your body
may not be achieved.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 295 (Number of characters: 704):
Fortunately, there are other modes of self-help for healing the
physiological wounds of Cptsd. The “Somatic Mindfulness” and “Introspective Somatic Work”
sections of chapter 12 describe techniques that can help you to decrease adrenalization, to relax
more deeply and to improve your digestion. Moreover, Step 7 of the flashback management steps
at the beginning of chapter 8 contains six somatic, self-help techniques for relaxing out of the
physiological hyperarousal of a flashback. Another especially helpful somatic practice is stretching. Regular systematic stretching of the
body’s major muscle groups can help you to reduce the armoring that occurs when your 4F
response is chronically triggered.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 296 (Number of characters: 732):
This results from the fact that 4F activation tightens and
contracts your body in anticipation of the need to fight back, flee, get small to escape notice, or
rev up to launch into people-pleasing activity. Learning to stretch was a major ordeal for me because of my extreme body armoring. As
noted above, it was a task of self-nurturing that I resented intensely, and it took me a long time to
adopt stretching as a regular practice. The fact that I had to weather many toxic shame attacks because I was always the least
flexible person in the group did not help matters. Moreover, when various people commented
about how good it felt to stretch, I felt both puzzled and further shamed, because it was anything
but pleasant for me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 297 (Number of characters: 170):
Thankfully however, reading the literature about it convinced me about its great
importance, and persistent practice eventually gave me results that I could not discount.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 298 (Number of characters: 62):
I was
rewarded by the resolution of decades old back problems.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 299 (Number of characters: 235):
And although I still rarely enjoy the
practice, I am absolutely convinced that it explains why I am still able to run, swim and play

basketball in my mid sixties. Stretching has become for me a true labor of love and self-
nurturance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 300 (Number of characters: 126):
Yoga, massage, meditation and relaxation training are formalized disciplines to aid in letting go
of unnecessary body tension.

chunk 301 (Number of characters: 88):
Reasonably priced classes in these modalities are usually available
in most communities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 302 (Number of characters: 133):
Finally, freeze types and freeze subtypes also typically benefit from various types of movement
therapy and aerobic exercise regimes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 303 (Number of characters: 457):
Moreover, assertiveness training and anger release work
are especially helpful for survivors who have difficulty accessing their assertiveness or instincts
of self-protection. Cptsd And Somatic Therapy
There are also various somatic therapies that can help our bodies heal. As with my earlier
comments about CBT, I encourage you to be wary of somatic approaches that claim to heal
Cptsd without working on the cognitive and emotional levels described above.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 304 (Number of characters: 130):
Some approaches,
in fact, blanketly dismiss cognitive work in a way that sidesteps the crucial work of shrinking the
inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 305 (Number of characters: 209):
Some approaches also believe that their techniques eliminate the fundamental
necessity of grieving the losses of childhood, and understanding how abusive and negligent
parenting is at the root of our problems.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 306 (Number of characters: 212):
Nonetheless, some somatic therapists can ease the physiological traumas that are locked in
our bodies, as long as the practitioner is not actively dismissing or impeding the client’s
cognitive and emotional work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 307 (Number of characters: 56):
In this vein, it is my opinion that techniques like EMDR

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 308 (Number of characters: 168):
[Eye Movement Desensitization
Reprocessing] and Somatic Experiencing are very powerful tools for stress-reduction. They are
especially helpful in resolving simple ptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 309 (Number of characters: 167):
However, they are not complete Cptsd therapies,
unless the practitioner is eclectic enough to be incorporating inner critic and grieving-the-losses-
of-childhood work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 310 (Number of characters: 415):
Other helpful somatic techniques include Rosen Work, Rolfing, Rebirthing and Reichian
work. These techniques can also be very helpful in aiding the recovery of the ability to
therapeutically emote both tears and anger. For survivors of physical and/or sexual abuse, I believe Rosen Work is especially helpful. I
found that Rosen Work’s emphasis on soft touch helped heal my Cptsd startle response to
physical touch.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 311 (Number of characters: 128):
A startle response is the sudden full body-flinching that survivors experience at
loud noises or unanticipated physical contact.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 312 (Number of characters: 55):
This is usually a somatic flashback to previous
abuses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 313 (Number of characters: 99):
In my case, the startle response was installed in me by my parents through frequent face-
slapping.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 314 (Number of characters: 157):
As a lap-swimmer in public pools, it has taken me ages to significantly reduce being
triggered by the hand and arm movements of people who swim alongside me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 315 (Number of characters: 435):
I also had to shop around to find a Rosen worker who welcomed my use of the verbal

ventilation process. Some practitioners prefer to work in silence, and this limits or eliminates the
therapeutic benefit to most survivors. It is also important to emphasize here that somatic therapies can be especially helpful in
healing the anxiety reaction to touch and physical closeness that many survivors of physical or
sexual abuse experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 316 (Number of characters: 722):
Exceptions to this are the survivors that I have met who have
experienced remediation of this symptom through the help of an especially kind and safe partner. The Role Of Medication
As a psychotherapist, I am not authorized to give pharmaceutical advice, but I have frequently
noticed that survivors who need pharmaceutical help seem to benefit most from SSRI anti-
depressants. Taken at the right dosage SSRI’s do not usually blunt your affect in a way that
makes grieving impossible. Moreover, if your critic does not budge with extended critic-
shrinking work, SSRI’s can usually reduce its volume and vitriol enough so that you can
effectively shrink it. Once it is diminished enough, you can dispense with medication.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 317 (Number of characters: 334):
One
caveat here is that unless you do extensive critic shrinking work, the critic will be as strong as
ever when the medications wear off. Self-Medication
For those who have been repeatedly unsuccessful at stopping or reducing the use of non-
therapeutic medications and substances, Gabor Mate’s work on harm reduction may be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 318 (Number of characters: 309):
Drug and alcohol recovery is beyond the scope of this book, but if you are stuck in habits of self-
medication that are not allowing you to progress in your Cptsd recovery, I encourage you to get
help from a substance abuse recovery program or from Twelve Step programs like Alcoholics or
Narcotics Anonymous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 319 (Number of characters: 106):
Working With Food Issues
Let us explore one last arena of physical healing, and that is dietary self-help.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 320 (Number of characters: 119):
I agree with John
Bradshaw who says that almost everyone who grows up in a dysfunctional family has an eating
disorder.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 321 (Number of characters: 88):
This is a key factor in the digestive track problems that are a common symptom of
Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 322 (Number of characters: 51):
Changing your eating habits is extremely difficult.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 323 (Number of characters: 473):
A client left this quote on my waiting
room bulletin board: “Alcohol and other drug recovery is like dealing with a tiger in a cage. Recovery from eating disorders is like taking that tiger out of the cage three times a day and then
taking it for a walk.” Deconstructing food addictions, then, is daunting work that needs to be approached
gradually and with a sense of compassion. This is because children who are traumatically
abandoned naturally turn to food for comfort.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 324 (Number of characters: 139):
Food offers us our first outside source of self-
soothing, and when a child is starving for love, he frequently makes food his love object.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 325 (Number of characters: 253):
Over
the years he commonly “elevates” it to the status of a drug. Moreover, increasing scientific
evidence is showing that processed food products combining high levels of sugar, salt and fat are
especially addictive. Food addictions begin pre-verbally.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 326 (Number of characters: 117):
They are functional and useful at the time and help us
to survive the unbearable feelings of the abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 327 (Number of characters: 268):
Unfortunately, we are typically
forced to rely on food-soothing for so long that this over-dependence is extremely difficult to
overcome, and I do not recommend that anyone in early recovery make this their primary focus
unless they have a life-threatening food issue.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 328 (Number of characters: 62):
Instead, I prefer to recommend Mate’s harm
reduction approach.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 329 (Number of characters: 463):
Additionally, Geneen Roth’s book, Breaking Free from Compulsive Eating,
also offers a moderate and sensible approach to dietary improvement. While many survivors can be unconscious of their damaging eating habits, I have met
various survivors who take it to the opposite extreme. I was once in the ranks of those who
obsessively over-focus on dietary self-help hoping and expecting that all their suffering will be
resolved if they can just find the perfect diet.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 330 (Number of characters: 73):
Many also chase after every new highly touted
supplement in this pursuit.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 331 (Number of characters: 49):
Some of us also approach exercise in this manner.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 332 (Number of characters: 163):
These are understandable but simplistic versions of the salvation fantasy, and are typically
pursued at the exclusion of working on more core issues of recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 333 (Number of characters: 97):
Nonetheless, almost
everyone has some ideas about how they can eat [and exercise] more healthily.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 334 (Number of characters: 89):
My
recommendation is to try dietary adjustments when you can on a moderate, doable level.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 335 (Number of characters: 182):
IMPROVING RELATIONSHIPS
Forewarning:
There are instances of parental betrayal so extreme, that it is not fair or reasonable to expect the
survivor to try to trust human beings again.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 336 (Number of characters: 143):
If the recommendation in this chapter to open to the
help of others feels too upsetting or overwhelming, please feel free to skip this chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 337 (Number of characters: 209):
There is
a great deal of other material in this book that can help alleviate the many symptoms of Cptsd,
and since recovery is relative and never complete, you do not need to implement everything in
this book.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 338 (Number of characters: 76):
As they say in the Twelve Step Movement: “Take the best and leave the rest.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 339 (Number of characters: 706):
Moreover, as I have experienced personally, and as numerous of my clients and website
respondents have demonstrated to me, real relational healing can and does come from non-
human sources. This is especially true of mammalian pets whose attachment needs and wiring
are similar enough to ours that mutually healing connections can evolve between us. Dogs and
cats can be a tremendous source of what Carl Rogers describes as the “unconditional positive
regard” that young children must have in order to thrive. Other therapeutic relational sources include nature, music and the arts. Moreover, for some
survivors, authors of helpful books can be kept at safe distances while they contribute to your
healing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 340 (Number of characters: 169):
Finally, even with the most heinous betrayals, miracles sometime happen in terms of
discovering a healing human connection, particularly in the later stages of recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 341 (Number of characters: 84):
Cptsd As An Attachment Disorder
Many therapists see Cptsd as an attachment disorder.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 342 (Number of characters: 92):
This means that as a child the survivor
grew up without a safe adult to healthily bond with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 343 (Number of characters: 574):
As bears repeating, Cptsd almost always has

emotional neglect at its core. A key outcome of this is that the child has no one in his formative
years who models the relational skills that are necessary to create intimacy. When the developmental need to practice healthy relating with a caretaker is unmet,
survivors typically struggle to find and maintain healthy supportive relationships in their adult
lives. The Origin Of Social Anxiety
A child who grows up with no reliable human source of love, support and protection typically
falls into a great deal of social unease.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 344 (Number of characters: 128):
He “naturally” becomes reluctant to seek support from
anyone, and he is forced to adopt self-sufficiency as a survival strategy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 345 (Number of characters: 285):
Needing anything from others can feel especially dangerous. The survivor’s innate capacity
to experience comfort and support in relationship becomes very limited or non-existent. This is
despite the fact that many high functioning survivors learn to socially function quite adequately.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 346 (Number of characters: 489):
This is particularly the case in structured situations where expectations are clear and
common goals take the focus off conversing and put it on task accomplishments. Unstructured
social situations however, like attending parties or just hanging out can be considerably more
triggering. Spontaneous self-expression feels like the same setup for disaster that it was in
childhood. Either way, structured or spontaneous, relating often involves hiding a great deal of anxiety
and discomfort.

--------------------------------------------------

A Journey Of Relational Healing
The incident I am about to describe marked a huge step in my long, gradual journey of opening
to real intimacy. I was sitting on my porch with my dog George, the only being I could truly
relax with, when he broke his lead and sprinted across the street in pursuit of a cat. Before he
could get to the cat, he was run over by a car – both axels-run over. It was the worst thing that

ever happened in my adult life, and when the shock [dissociation] wore off, I was drowning in
the abandonment mélange. Beyond devastated, I felt panicky and catatonic at the same time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 359 (Number of characters: 146):
As I had to in childhood
when feeling overwhelmed, I hid in my room for thirty-six hours - dreading contact with my fair
weather friend-roommates.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 360 (Number of characters: 69):
I was 28 and still thoroughly phobic about showing any vulnerability.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 361 (Number of characters: 568):
All my relationships had been developed under the guise of my people-pleasing, funny guy
persona, and in my current state there was not a joke anywhere to be found. There was no way I
would let myself be seen in what felt like a repulsive condition. I could not sleep, and as sleep deprivation deteriorated into a fear that I was truly going
crazy, out of nowhere came this amazing grace. Grace disguised in a form I usually abhorred. It
was the grace of a deep surrender into weeping - a long sobbing release more soothing than
anything I had ever experienced before.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 362 (Number of characters: 85):
It was the release I describe in chapter 11 and extensively throughout my first book.

I could
face my roommates with the realest, perhaps the first sense of self-esteem I had ever known. And
from that point on, I knew I wanted more of these incredibly healing tears. Healing The Shame That Binds Us In Loneliness
I soon discovered however, that my tears were as stuck as they had ever been, or at least since I
was six – the last time I could remember crying. Further reading and researching then lead me to
seek help, and so ensued my baptism into therapy, blessed by the great fortune of finding a good
enough therapist on the first try. This was a milestone achievement for me, and it evolved into a long meandering journey of
finding more relational help with an array of healers, therapists, therapeutic groups and deeper
friendships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 366 (Number of characters: 547):
These experiences ranged from extremely helpful to counter-therapeutic, but as time
went on they became increasingly helpful. A central aspect of the truly helpful relational work was what John Bradshaw called
“healing the shame that binds.” I believe toxic shame cannot be healed without some relational
help. Several therapists and groups aided me greatly to unbind from the shame that made me
hide whenever I could not invoke my perfect persona. Concurrently, I learned that real intimacy
correlated with the amount I shared my vulnerabilities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 367 (Number of characters: 584):
As I increasingly practiced emotional
authenticity, the glacier of my lifelong loneliness began to melt. It is important to note here that groups can be even more powerful for the healing of shame
than individual work. This is because there is typically more mutual vulnerability in a group than
in individual work. Moreover, feeling compassion for someone who has suffered similarly to us
sometimes naturally expands into feeling the same for ourselves. Therapeutic relational experiences enhanced my self-compassion considerably further than
what I was able to accomplish on my own.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 368 (Number of characters: 698):
Moreover, I believe that insufficient self-compassion
is the worst developmental arrest of all, and restored self-compassion is the keystone of all
effective recovery. In retrospect I can clearly see that as my self-compassion increased, my toxic shame
decreased. Modern advances in neuroscience [see: A General Theory of Love] suggest that we
are intrinsically limited in our ability to emotionally regulate and soothe ourselves. More and

more research suggests that our ability to metabolize painful emotional states is enhanced by
communicating with a safe enough other person. Finding Good Enough Relational Help
In chapter 13, I provide guidance about how to shop for a good enough therapist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 369 (Number of characters: 788):
I also explore
more deeply the principles of therapeutic relational healing to help you know what is reasonable
to expect from your therapist. I have also met a number of survivors who have been lucky enough to get this kind of relational
healing from a partner or a friend, typically one who had good enough parents or who “has a lot
of recovery”. Finally, attachment theorists have developed the concept of earned secure attachment to
describe the recovered enough state where the attachment disorder of Cptsd becomes sufficiently
healed. This is typically evidenced by the survivor forming at least one supportive and reliable
enough relationship. Many of the successful therapies I have guided come to an end when the client gains an
earned secure relationship outside of our therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 370 (Number of characters: 257):
This is typically a partner or best friend with
whom the person can truly be themselves. Another potential source of relational healing is the co-counseling relationship. Guidelines
for creating a co-counseling relationship are also contained in chapter 13.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 371 (Number of characters: 395):
Many respondents to my website have reported glowingly about the help they get from others
through online recovery groups and forums. These groups can be particularly helpful for those
who still find it difficult to be vulnerable in person. Sometimes the distance and relative
anonymity of these forums can decrease the fear of self-disclosure, and this in turn can enhance
therapeutic relating.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 372 (Number of characters: 100):
An increasing number of therapists also seem to be offering telephone
sessions for this same reason.

Through in depth exploration of their childhood trauma, many of my still-trapped clients

achieved psychological freedom from their parents for the first time in their lives.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 379 (Number of characters: 435):
Once again,
this was a freedom that they had not actually achieved even though they had been living on their
own for decades. These clients gradually learned to live more successfully on their own without their parents
over-controlling spoiling influence. Their ability to build self-nurturing relationships with
themselves almost always correlated with a major reduction or complete severing of their
relationships with their parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 380 (Number of characters: 777):
My client, Joe, who was variously misdiagnosed as Schizoid, Asperger’s, and Paranoid,
was living alone when he began therapy with me. He was extremely shut down and self-
contained but recognized himself as a freeze type from reading articles on my website. Getting him to talk at first was like pulling teeth, but over time I discovered that he was
engaged in daily phone contact with his narcissistic, emasculating mother. Through our work and
tremendous courage on his part, he gradually reduced the phone contact with his mother: at first
to once a week, then once a month, then only major holidays, and after a few years to almost
never. When a parent is unrelentingly toxic, hearing even a few words from them can trigger the
survivor into an intense emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 381 (Number of characters: 214):
I have worked with numerous clients who made
very little progress in their recovery while they maintained contact with the toxic parent[s]. For
this reason, such clients usually require a parentdectomy to progress.

There is a classic book by
Bob Hoffman on this topic entitled Getting Divorced from Mother & Dad.

chunk 383 (Number of characters: 454):
As external freedom from “smother-mothering” continued, Joe gradually achieved more
and more internal freedom from her. During this time he began to experience the first meaningful
relating of his life in an ACA group that for many years provided him with a great deal of
positive companionship and relational healing. Joe finally concluded therapy with me when a
healthy primary relationship that he formed with a group member reached the two year mark.

Learning To Handle Conflict In Relationship
One caveat for recovering the ability to authentically be yourself is that it is unreasonable and

Some
trauma survivors flashback into this type of behavior by acting out from their Outer Critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 386 (Number of characters: 453):
If this
is an issue for you, chapter 10 provides guidance for deconstructing this intimacy-destroying
habit. In this vein, it is important to note that intimacy does not mean unconditional love. As John
Gottman’s scholarly research shows, a certain amount of disagreement, disaffection and
disappointment is normal in relationship. The hallmark of successful couples is their ability to
handle feelings of anger and hurt in a constructive and civil way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 387 (Number of characters: 304):
Gottman’s studies have

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 396 (Number of characters: 571):
Self-Mothering And Self-Fathering
An important, yin/yang dynamic of reparenting involves balancing self-mothering and self-
fathering. When a child’s mothering needs are adequately met, self-compassion is installed at the
core of her being. When the same is true of her fathering needs, self-protection also becomes
deeply imbedded. Self-compassion is the domicile of recovery, and self-protection is its foundation. When
self-compassion is sufficiently established as a “home base” to return to in difficult times, an
urge to be self-protective naturally arises from it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 397 (Number of characters: 93):
Living in the world without access to these
primal instincts of survival is truly terrifying.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 398 (Number of characters: 635):
We advance our recovery process immeasurably when we commit to re-mothering and re-
fathering ourselves. I encourage you now to commit to becoming an unshakeable source of
compassion and protection for yourself. Self-Mothering Grows Self-Compassion
The most essential task of self-mothering is building a deeply felt sense that we are lovable and
deserve to be loved. Self-mothering is the practice of loving and accepting the inner child in all
phases of his mental, emotional, and physical experience. [If “inner child” is a problematic
concept for any reason, you can imagine nurturing the developmentally arrested part of yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 399 (Number of characters: 93):
]
Self-mothering is based on the precept that unconditional love is every child’s birthright.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 400 (Number of characters: 62):
Recovering from the loss of unconditional love is problematic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 401 (Number of characters: 66):
Not getting enough of it as
children was the greatest loss we had.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 402 (Number of characters: 723):
Sadly, this loss can never be completely remediated,
because unconditional love is only appropriate and developmentally helpful during the first two
years or so of life. After this time, the toddler has to begin to learn that human love comes with some
conditions. Although love still needs to be copious at this time, the child must be gently shown
that behaviors like hitting, biting and breaking things are not acceptable. The period of
conditional love has begun and is successfully guided via a very gradual increase in learning
about necessary and healthy limits and rules. The toddler who receives good enough parenting learns relatively easily to survive the very
gradually diminishing supply of unconditional love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 403 (Number of characters: 361):
During this time she learns little by little that
other people also have rights and needs. Her absolute entitlement to gratification is coming to an
end, and the needs of her parents will not always be forfeited to accommodate her. Once again, psychological health is based on having about two years of this no questions
asked entitlement to unconditional love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 404 (Number of characters: 83):
It is the normal healthy narcissism that Freud described
as “His Majesty the Baby”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 405 (Number of characters: 515):
Serious problems accrue however when the toddler does not begin to learn that there are
limits to his original entitlement. If there are no limits for too long, then the journey toward adult
narcissism begins. On the other hand, if there are too many limits too soon, the matrix of trauma
begins to form. Enlightened parents introduce limits slowly but surely. They do it at such a rate that by the
time the child reaches adolescence he can balance satisfying his needs with helping his intimates
to satisfy theirs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 406 (Number of characters: 526):
He learns to be sharing and reciprocal, a developmental task that is essential to
keeping intimacy alive in his life. Cptsd is a syndrome of the dearth of unconditional love, or what the great therapist, Carl
Rogers, called “unconditional positive regard”. Cptsd can also occur when unconditional love is
shut off in an all-or-nothing way in early childhood. Some parents can shower love on babies. But as soon as the child begins toddling around
and expressing a will of her own, they become severely punishing and rejecting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 407 (Number of characters: 341):
The Limits Of Unconditional Love
The terrible absence of love - or its abrupt premature termination - is extremely painful and its
loss is very difficult to address. We cannot help desperately wanting the unconditional love we
were so unfairly deprived of, but we cannot, as adults, expect others to supply our unmet early
entitlement needs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 408 (Number of characters: 667):
The one exception to this is therapy, but that of course is usually only one or two hours a
week. Miraculously, I have seen the unconditional positive regard of the therapist be enough on
numerous occasions to significantly repair the damage of not being parentally loved. And when
it is enough, the therapist’s consistent caring facilitates the awakening of the developmentally
arrested need to hold yourself with enough unconditional love. We survivors often struggle with managing our understandable but unrealistic yearnings to
receive permanent unconditional love from a friend or partner. Like the toddler, we eventually
have to accept the limits of adult love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 409 (Number of characters: 724):
This is especially true in romance where the intoxication
of unconditional love rarely lasts for more than year. Around this time, partners inevitably begin
to feel some frustration with each other because of differences in their individual needs. Nonetheless, romantic love can be a significant source of therapeutic unconditional-like
love, especially when it survives the inevitability of some disappointment. Susan Campbell’s A
Couples’ Journey is a pragmatic, research-based book on how to reap more intimacy out of
normal relationship disappointments
Inner Child Work
Let us return to the concept of self-mothering. As mother to ourselves, we commit to increasing
our self-compassion and unconditional positive regard.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 410 (Number of characters: 162):
Self-mothering is a resolute refusal to
indulge in self-hatred and self-abandonment. It proceeds from the realization that self-

punishment is counterproductive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 411 (Number of characters: 153):
It is enhanced by the understanding that patience and self-
encouragement are more effective than self-judgment and self-rejection in achieving recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 412 (Number of characters: 513):
You can enhance your self-mothering skills by imaginatively creating a safe place in your
heart where your inner child and your present time self are always welcome. Consistent
tenderness towards yourself welcomes the child into the adult body you now inhabit, and shows
him that it is now a nurturing place protected by a warm and powerful adult. Self-mothering can be enhanced by thought-correcting the critic’s negative messages with
healing words that the child in all likelihood never heard from his parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 413 (Number of characters: 193):
A client of mine once
shared this pearl of wisdom with me: “Thoughts - just mere thoughts - are as powerful as electric

Self-Fathering And Time Machine Rescue Operation
Many abandoned children enter adulthood feeling that the world is a dangerous place where they
are ill-equipped to defend themselves. While self-mothering focuses primarily on healing the
wounds of neglect, self-fathering heals the wounds of being helpless to protect yourself from
parental abuse, and by extension from other abusive authority figures. Self-fathering aims at building assertiveness and self-protection. It includes learning to
effectively confront external and/or internal abuse, as well as standing up for the adult child’s
rights, as described in Tool Box 2 of chapter 16.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 432 (Number of characters: 80):
Many survivors benefit greatly from classes and
books on assertiveness training.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 433 (Number of characters: 275):
One of my favorite self-fathering exercises is the time machine rescue operation. I have

used it to help myself and to help clients. With clients I use it to model a process for fighting off
the overwhelming sense of helplessness that often accompanies emotional flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 434 (Number of characters: 105):
This is a version of the time machine rescue operation that I use with myself as well as with
my clients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 435 (Number of characters: 207):
I tell my inner child that, if time travel is ever possible, I will travel back into the past
and put a stop to my parents’ abusiveness. In the course of this I say things like: “I’ll call 911. I’ll call CPS

[Child Protective Services] on them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 437 (Number of characters: 248):
I will grab their arms and pin them behind their

Such imagery often provides me an exit out of fear and shame, and sometimes even makes
my inner child laugh in delight.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 441 (Number of characters: 180):
I sometimes finish this exercise by telling my inner child I would
also report my parents to the authorities so they would be sent to counseling to learn how to be a
better parent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 442 (Number of characters: 133):
Or, I say that, if I could, I would take him back to live with me in the future before all those
horrible things could happen to him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 443 (Number of characters: 109):
I remind him that he in fact lives in the present with me
now, where I will always do my best to protect him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 444 (Number of characters: 473):
We now have a powerful body, greater
skills of self-protection and access to allies and a legal system that will protect us. When the recoveree consistently welcomes his inner child in every aspect of his being, the
child feels increasingly safe and becomes more and more alive and self-expressive. As he
experiences his adult self consistently rising to his defense, he will feel safe enough to begin
accessing his innate vitality, playfulness, curiosity, and spontaneity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 445 (Number of characters: 497):
Reparenting By Committee
Reparenting at its best is a yin/yang dynamic that balances the mutually enhancing processes of
reparenting by others and self-reparenting. Reparenting sometimes needs to be initiated and
modeled by someone else, such as a therapist, a sponsor, a kind friend or supportive group to
show us how to self-reparent ourselves. Alternatively, many survivors instinctively initiate reparenting by others, via entering what
one of my clients describes as “the community of books”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 446 (Number of characters: 89):
They receive reparenting from authors
who encourage them to value and support themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 447 (Number of characters: 675):
Alice was such a survivor. Her family traumatized her during childhood so thoroughly that
she quickly learned that being vulnerable around others was dangerous, foolish and totally out of
the question. Yet the urge to get the support and the help she was so unfairly deprived of worked
its way back into her awareness via a strong attraction to self-help books. By reading a great deal
of psychology, she eventually found enough help that she began to think that there might be a
kind, safe and helpful person out there in the flesh and entered into some very helpful therapy. [Chapter 15, Bibliotherapy, contains my favorite recommendations for therapeutic self-help
books].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 448 (Number of characters: 396):
I too went through a long gradual process of reading and attending lectures before I was
able to take the frightening and embarrassing plunge into therapy, where, as stated earlier, I was
fortunate enough to find a good enough therapist to take my relational healing to the next level. Therapy allowed me to internalize and mimic my therapists’ consistent and reliable stance
of being on my side.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 449 (Number of characters: 83):
This in turn led me to gravitate toward safer and more truly intimate

friendships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 450 (Number of characters: 63):
I have seen this same result with numerous clients and friends.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 451 (Number of characters: 192):
Eventually, I achieved my first earned secure attachment outside of therapy and was
subsequently ready to let go of therapy as the only place where I could have deep and
meaningful connection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 452 (Number of characters: 565):
I believe the need to have mothering- and fathering-type support from others is a lifelong
need and not just limited to childhood. Fortunately I am now blessed many years later to
experience a multileveled form of reparenting by others which I call reparenting by committee. I
conceptualize reparenting by committee as a circle of friends that has varying layers and levels of
intimacy. The inner circle of my reparenting committee includes my five closest friends. I think of this inner circle as friends with whom nothing is too vulnerable or taboo to talk
about.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 453 (Number of characters: 734):
My wife, a therapist friend, my exercise buddy and two members of a long term men’s
group that I was in are in this circle. This circle also has an outer layer of people who would be
inner if circumstances allowed me to see them more. Outside this orb are levels of succeeding less intimate, yet still meaningful circles of
relationship. The next circle out is intimates who I rarely see anymore but who have shared
enough intimacy with me in the past that I now draw comfort from imagining them caring for me
in the present. My deceased grandmother is in this circle as are three of my former therapists, a
couple of army buddies, old high school and college friends, and my four best friends from the
ten years I lived in Australia.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 454 (Number of characters: 596):
The next circle out from this consists of my nurse practitioner, the body worker I
occasionally see, some therapist colleagues and the wise old school librarian who helps me pick
books for my son to read. The next circle out from this are friends I play sports with, parents of my son’s friends and
people in my neighborhood with whom my contact is not especially vulnerable, but with whom
there is an easy chemistry that adds to my general overall sense of belonging. And the final circle is occasional strangers, who from time to time, I am graced to have easy
and comforting interactions with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 455 (Number of characters: 760):
I also know various survivors whose effective recovery practices have similarly rewarded
them with enough portions of love from a variety of others that their childhood starvation for
help and support is significantly assuaged. And like me, their committees, started with the first
person they had good enough intimacy with. Counting yourself, this then is a committee of two,
which with grace can then build slowly, one friendship at a time. The Tao Of Self-Relating And Relating To Others
Recovering is therefore enhanced on every level by safe human help. Once again however,
survivors with especially harsh betrayal histories may need to do a great deal of work on other
levels before they are ready to risk the vulnerability of opening to relational help.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 456 (Number of characters: 637):
Nonetheless, deep level recovering, as well as healthy “human-being” is typically a
vacillating blend of self-help and help from others. Relational work helps heal the initial wound
of family abandonment, and self work decreases the self-abandonment that occurs because the
child was forced to imitate his parents’ abandonment of him. The more time you practice the
various techniques of self-care described throughout this book, the less time you spend in self-
abandonment. With enough persistence, self-care becomes an invaluable, irreplaceable habit. In advanced recovery, self-help and relational-help blend in an all important Tao.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 457 (Number of characters: 597):
A Tao is a
yin/yang combination of opposite and complementary forces. The Tao of relational recovery
involves balancing healthy independence with healthy dependence on others. For the survivor, this therapeutic synthesis can come into being when an improved
supportive relationship with yourself allows you to choose and open to a helpful relationship. Sometimes simultaneously, the attainment of a safe, supportive relationship with another person
promotes the growth of your ability to be self-supportive. This then rewards you with a decrease
in your automatic tendency toward self-abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 458 (Number of characters: 654):
Complementarily, this then fosters the
gradual development of community – the vital life resource that you were so unfairly deprived of
in childhood. The more self-supportive we become the more we attract supportive others. The more we
are supported by others, the more we can support ourselves. Sometimes we get initiated into this
dynamic Tao by our own efforts - sometimes by the grace of finding a supportive friend or
professional helper. For many of us survivors a considerable amount of self-help work has to take place before
we are able to open to relational support – before we become discerning enough to choose truly
safe and helpful support.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 459 (Number of characters: 128):
THE PROGRESSION OF RECOVERING
Signs Of Recovering
Effective recovery work leads to an ongoing reduction of emotional flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 460 (Number of characters: 538):
Over time, with
enough practice, you become more proficient at managing triggered states. This in turn results in
flashbacks occurring less often, less intensely and less enduringly. Another key sign of recovering is that your critic begins to shrink and lose its dominance
over your psyche. As it shrinks, your user-friendly ego has room to grow and to develop the kind
of mindfulness that recognizes when the critic has taken over. This in turn allows you to
progressively reject the critic’s perfectionistic and drasticizing processes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 461 (Number of characters: 64):
More and more, you
stop persecuting yourself for normal foibles.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 462 (Number of characters: 88):
Additionally, you perseverate less in
disappointment about other people’s minor miscues.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 463 (Number of characters: 76):
A further sign of recovering is a gradual increase in your ability to relax.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 464 (Number of characters: 565):
With this comes
an increasing ability to resist overreacting from a triggered position. This further allows you to
use your fight, flight, freeze and fawn instincts in healthy and non-self-destructive ways. This
means you only fight back when under real attack, only flee when odds are insurmountable, only
freeze when you need to go into acute observation mode, and only fawn when it is appropriate to
be self-sacrificing. An alternative way of describing this decrease in overreacting is that you have a good
balance between the polar opposites of fight and fawn.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 465 (Number of characters: 138):
As this becomes increasingly realized,
you vacillate healthily between asserting your own needs and compromising with the needs of
others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 466 (Number of characters: 304):
A further example of decreased reactivity is seen in a more balanced movement between the
polar opposites of flight and freeze. This manifests as an improving equilibrium between doing
and being, between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system arousal, and between left
and right-brain processing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 467 (Number of characters: 143):
The importance of balancing the fight-fawn and flight-freeze

polarities within yourself is explored in greater detail at the end of chapter 6.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 468 (Number of characters: 211):
Deep-level recovery is also evidenced by you becoming gradually more relaxed in safe
enough company. This in turn leads to an increasing capacity to be more authentic and
vulnerable in trustworthy relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 469 (Number of characters: 708):
With enough grace, this may then culminate in you
acquiring an intimate, mutually supportive relationship where each of you can be there for the
other through thick and thin. Advanced recovery also correlates with letting go of the salvation fantasy that you will
never have another flashback. Giving up the salvation fantasy is another one of those two steps
forward, one step backward processes. We typically have to wrestle with denial a great deal to
increasingly accept the unfair reality that we will never be totally flashback-free. Unless we do
however, we impair our ability to easily recognize and quickly respond to flashbacks from a
position of self-compassion, self-soothing and self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 470 (Number of characters: 376):
The Stages Of Recovering
Although we often work on many levels of recovering at the same time, recovering is to some
degree progressive. It begins on the cognitive level when psychoeducation and mindfulness helps
us understand that we have Cptsd. This awakening then allows us to learn how to approach the
journey of deconstructing the various life-spoiling dynamics of Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 471 (Number of characters: 547):
Still on the cognitive level, we take our next steps into the long work of shrinking the critic. Some survivors will need to do a great deal of work on this level before they can move down to
the emotional layer of work which is learning how to grieve effectively. The phase of intensely grieving our childhood losses can last for a couple of years. When
sufficient progress is made in grieving, the survivor naturally drops down into the next level of
recovery work. This involves working through fear by grieving our loss of safety in the world.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 472 (Number of characters: 729):
At
this level, we also learn to work through our toxic shame by grieving the loss of our self-esteem. As we become more adept in this type of deep level grieving, we are then ready to address
the core issue of our trauma – the abandonment depression itself. Work here involves releasing
the armoring and physiological reactivity in our body to the abandonment depression via the
somatic work discussed in chapter 12. This work culminates with learning to compassionately
support ourselves through our experiences of depression. Finally, as we will learn more about in chapter 13, many survivors need some relational
help in achieving the complex tasks involved in deconstructing each layer of our old pain-
exacerbating defenses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 473 (Number of characters: 112):
Cultivating Patience With The Gradual Progression Of Recovery
As stated earlier, recovery from Cptsd is complex.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 474 (Number of characters: 333):
Sometimes, it can feel so hopelessly complex
that we totally give up and get stuck in inertia for considerable lengths of time. This is why it is
so important to understand that recovery is gradual and frequently a backwards and forwards
process. Effective recovery is often limited to only progressing in one or two areas at a time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 475 (Number of characters: 103):
Biting
off more than we can chew and trying to accomplish too much too soon is often
counterproductive.

chunk 476 (Number of characters: 133):
As a flight type, I spent years in mid-range recovery workaholically spinning

my wheels trying to fix and change everything at once.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 477 (Number of characters: 122):
I describe this at greater length in the
“When Recovery becomes Obsessive-Compulsive” section of my first book [p140-141].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 478 (Number of characters: 66):
We often need to simplify our self-help efforts in early recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 479 (Number of characters: 656):
Accordingly, I
recommend making shrinking the critic [chapter 9] your “go to” response if you feel unsure of
how to proceed. Once the critic is reduced enough that you can notice increasing periods of your brain being
user-friendly, impulses to help and care for yourself naturally begin to arise. As this happens it
becomes easier to tell whether you are guiding yourself with love or a whip. When you realize
it’s the whip, please try to disarm your critic and treat yourself with the kindness you would
extend to any young child who is struggling and having a hard time. Nowhere is patience with ourselves more important than with the inner critic work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 480 (Number of characters: 76):
Typically the
inner critic is too omnipresent to confront on every occasion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 481 (Number of characters: 53):
To do so would often leave no time
for anything else.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 482 (Number of characters: 189):
But when we practice critic-shrinking in a gradually increasing way over time, we can more
consistently disidentify from its negative focus and switch to a more self-supportive perspective.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 483 (Number of characters: 101):
Eventually a new positive habit of rescuing ourselves from shame and self-hate takes on its own
life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 484 (Number of characters: 91):
I still have my unfair share of flashbacks, but rarely do I ever side with my toxic critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 485 (Number of characters: 166):
Any self-help practices that we are trying to make second nature often work in this way. When we practice enough, self-help starts to become a matter of common sense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 486 (Number of characters: 551):
It reverberates
as right action and gradually takes on its own life as we attune to the true nature of our spirits
and souls which are inherently self-supportive. We also aid our recovery greatly by challenging the all-or-none thinking of the critic whenever it
judges us for not being perfect in our efforts. “Progress not perfection” is a powerful mantra for
guiding our self-help recovery efforts. Moreover as recovering progresses, and especially as the critic shrinks, the desire to help
yourself- to care for yourself - becomes more spontaneous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 487 (Number of characters: 290):
This is especially true when we
mindfully do things for ourselves in a spirit of loving-kindness. As such, we can do it for the
child we were – the child who was deprived through no fault of her own. And, we can do it
because we believe every child, without exception, deserves loving care.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 488 (Number of characters: 180):
Finally, if the reader is like I was in the past and has no overall perspective on his suffering,
he may feel like he is spinning his wheels on one icy patch of road after another.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 489 (Number of characters: 117):
I had decades of
trying everything under the sun with what felt like a deepening sense of futility and
defectiveness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 490 (Number of characters: 105):
Gratefully, I eventually reached an invisible critical mass, and realized I had
actually come a long way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 491 (Number of characters: 128):
I had acquired quite a few pieces in this puzzle of recovery, and only
needed to organize them into a map to move along further.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 492 (Number of characters: 167):
As such, I have designed a ground
plan that has helped me, my clients and website respondents to make sense of their suffering and
to see how to effectively reduce it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 493 (Number of characters: 77):
I hope and pray that the cartography in this book will also
offer you relief.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 494 (Number of characters: 115):
Surviving Versus Thriving
Recovery involves learning to handle unpredictable shifts in our inner emotional weather.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 495 (Number of characters: 390):
Perhaps the ultimate dimension of this is what I call the Surviving 
Thriving
continuum. Before we enter into recovery, it may feel like life is nothing but a struggle to survive. However, when recovery progresses enough, we begin to have some experiences of feeling like
we are thriving. These may start out as feelings of optimism, hopefulness and certainty that we
are indeed recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 496 (Number of characters: 326):
And then, the bottom inevitably drops out because recovery is never all forward progress. Oh so unfairly, we are back to feeling that we can barely survive. To make matters worse, we are
amnesiac that we even had a respite from surviving. Another flashback has hit and we polarize
back onto the surviving end of the continuum.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 497 (Number of characters: 175):
We are stuck in the anxious and deadened feelings
of the abandonment mélange. In survival mode, even the most trivial and normally easy task can feel excruciatingly
difficult.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 498 (Number of characters: 47):
As in childhood, it is all feels just too hard.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 499 (Number of characters: 663):
And if the flashback is especially intense,
Thanatos may start knocking down the door. Thanatos is the death urge described by Freud and
in a flashback it corresponds with the suicidal ideation we looked at in chapter 1. Once again, it is important to repeat that this feeling-state is a flashback to the worst times
in childhood when our will to live was so compromised. As mindfulness improves we can
recognize suicidal ideation as evidence of a flashback and begin to rescue ourselves with the
chapter 8 flashback management steps. As recovery progresses, polarizations back into survival mode do not take us to the utter
despair end of the continuum so often.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 500 (Number of characters: 489):
Nonetheless survival mode can still feel pretty awful,
especially when it is characterized by high anxiety or immobilizing depression. Being in survival is especially difficult during those times when flashback management is
less effective, and feelings that life is a struggle can hang on for days and even weeks. This is the
territory where flashbacks morph into extended regressions. I believe regressions are sometimes a call from our psyche to address important
developmental arrests.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 501 (Number of characters: 504):
In this case, it is the need to learn unrelenting self-acceptance during a
period of extended difficulty. It is also the need to develop a staunch and unyielding sense of
self-protection. This fundamental instinct of fiery willingness to defend ourselves from
unfairness needs to strengthen progressively so that we can withstand inner critic attacks. Moreover we can grow in our ability to survive “survival” by using the chapter 13
mindfulness techniques to practice and build enduring self-compassion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 502 (Number of characters: 168):
Moreover, if we are far
enough along in recovery to have a safe ally, we can enlist their support to help us verbally
ventilate out our pain at being stuck in survival.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 503 (Number of characters: 126):
Temptations can be great at such times to revert to the less functional ways of self-soothing
that we learned when we younger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 504 (Number of characters: 546):
Depending on your 4F type this commonly manifests as
increased eating, substance abuse, working, sleeping and/or sexually acting out. Sometimes we are triggered into self-medicating in this way because we are desperately
trying to keep ourselves on the thriving end of the continuum. Desperately clinging to thriving is
a hard impulse to resist, even when we are in reality way past its expiration date. Yet as recovery and mindfulness increase we begin to notice that this type of self-

medicating indicates that we are in a survival-flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 505 (Number of characters: 68):
We are no longer authentically on the
thriving end of the continuum.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 506 (Number of characters: 879):
We have compounded our regression, by regressing further - by
self-medicating to unnaturally prolong a preferred experience. At such times, we benefit most by
reinvoking our intention to practice self-acceptance – by recommitting to being there for
ourselves no matter where we are on the continuum. As bears repeating, all human beings are existentially challenged to handle disappointing
shifts out of thriving into surviving. We survivors however have greater difficulties handling
these transitions because we were abandoned for so long at the surviving end of the continuum. Yet as our recovery progresses, we can learn to become increasingly self-supportive in times of
being stuck in survival.
Difficulties In Identifying The Signs Of Recovering
Some readers may work on their recovery for a long time, and erroneously and shamefully feel
they are not making any progress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 507 (Number of characters: 299):
Because of the all-or-none thinking that typically accompanies
Cptsd, survivors in the early stages of recovery often fail to notice or validate their own actual
progress. If we do not notice the degrees of our own improvement in our recovery work, we are in
great danger of giving up on recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 508 (Number of characters: 228):
Because of black-and-white thinking, we can regularly
fall into the trap of not acknowledging and valuing what we are actually accomplishing. Perfectionistic dismissal of improvement that is not 100% is common in early recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 509 (Number of characters: 140):
Here are some common areas where I see that recovering survivors fail to notice and self-
validate their progressive degrees of improvement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 510 (Number of characters: 2):
1.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 511 (Number of characters: 44):
Less intense launching into a 4F response
2.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 512 (Number of characters: 104):
Increasing resistance to the critic
3. Increased Mindfulness about flashbacks or inner critic attacks
4.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 513 (Number of characters: 52):
Increased time feeling good enough about yourself
5.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 514 (Number of characters: 64):
Progress in meeting arrested developments listed in chapter 2
6.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 515 (Number of characters: 60):
Decreased overeating or use of self-medicating substances
7.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 516 (Number of characters: 60):
Increased experiences of good enough relating with others
8.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 517 (Number of characters: 308):
Decrease in the painfulness and intensity of flashback feelings
In terms of number 3 above, it is important to note that even when mindfulness does not
immediately terminate a flashback or critic attack, noticing and identifying these Cptsd
phenomena is more progressive than just being blindly lost in them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 518 (Number of characters: 504):
Moreover, ongoing
recognition makes effective ameliorative action more accessible. It makes us increasingly likely
to remember to use the flashback management steps listed in chapter 8. Furthermore, it is important that we notice the gradually decreasing intensity of the
flashback feelings of anxiety, shame and depression. In this regard, social anxiety can gradually
reduce along a continuum that stretches from panicky withdrawal... to a more tolerable social
discomfort... to periods of social ease.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 519 (Number of characters: 231):
Additionally, depression can gradually diminish along a
continuum that stretches from paralyzing despair... to anhedonia – an inability to enjoy normal
life pleasures... to a state of tired, and relatively unmotivated peacefulness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 520 (Number of characters: 88):
Of course both these

processes typically improve at a vacillating, back-and-forth rate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 521 (Number of characters: 570):
As I write this I feel some old sadness about the many decades that I judged my emotional
tone and mood as either good or bad in a very all-or-nothing way. If I was not feeling very good
than I felt as if everything was really bad. And since feeling very good is something most human
beings only get to experience a relatively small proportion of the time, my perception of feeling
bad became a much more dominant experience than was necessary. In fact, mildly unpleasant
feeling typically morphed me quickly into feeling terrible via shame-tinged, all-or-none thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 522 (Number of characters: 285):
I am so grateful for the life-changing epiphany that lead me to trade in my old primary
aspiration of “Celebration” for my new one of “Serenity.”
Inner critic thought processes refute signs of progress whenever a new flashback occurs, no
matter how much less intense it is than before.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 523 (Number of characters: 675):
Every recurrence of feeling shame, fear or
depression is interpreted as proof that nothing has changed, even when there are increasing
periods of not being triggered. The critic’s black-and-white assessment is: “Either I’m cured or I’m still hopelessly
defective.” And once you identify with your critic’s pronouncement of defectiveness, you are off
and spiraling downward into a full-fledged flashback - captured once again in the ice veneer of
toxic shame that freezes one in the Cptsd stranglehold of helplessness and hopelessness. Accepting Recovery As A Lifelong Process It is exceedingly difficult to accept the proposition – the fact – that recovery is never complete.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 524 (Number of characters: 692):
And although we can expect our flashbacks to markedly decrease over time, it is tremendously
difficult, and sometimes impossible, to let go of the salvation fantasy that we will one day be
forever free of them. Yet when we do not loosen our grip on the salvation fantasy, we remain extremely
susceptible to blaming ourselves every time we have a flashback. Understanding this is so crucial
because recovery typically progresses in a process that has many temporary regressions. Moreover, most recoverees often have the unfortunate subjective experience that the temporary
regression feels as permanent as concrete. This is especially true because of the interminability
feeling of flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 525 (Number of characters: 155):
When we flashback, we regress to our child-mind which was incapable of
imagining a future any different than the everlasting present of being so abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 526 (Number of characters: 451):
So how can we come to bear the knowledge that our awful childhoods have created some
permanent damage? It helps me to see my Cptsd as somewhat analogous to diabetes, i.e., a
condition that will need management throughout my life. This is a piece of bad news that
naturally feels offensively unpalatable, but the good news, as with diabetes, is that as we become
more skilled at flashback management, Cptsd can gradually become infrequently bothersome.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 527 (Number of characters: 95):
And even more importantly, we can evolve towards leading increasingly rich and rewarding
lives.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 528 (Number of characters: 83):
Even better news is that Cptsd, when efficiently managed, eventually bestows gifts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 529 (Number of characters: 124):
It
comes with significant silver linings - unavailable to those less traumatized - as we will see at the
end of the chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 530 (Number of characters: 183):
Therapeutic Flashbacks And Growing Pains

Healing from childhood trauma is also a long gradual process because recovering your full self-
expression requires a great deal of practice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 531 (Number of characters: 59):
Being yourself can be intimidating and flashback-
inducing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 532 (Number of characters: 88):
Healthy self-assertion was punished like a capital crime in many dysfunctional
families.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 533 (Number of characters: 101):
Expressing yourself in ways that your parents forbade typically triggers intense
flashbacks at first.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 534 (Number of characters: 427):
This can cause you to lose sight of how this practice gradually reduces the
chronic pain of remaining invisible. We can encourage ourselves to face these growing pains by conceptualizing them as
therapeutic flashbacks. We then choose to weather these flashbacks to stop the past from holding
us back, to reclaim the fundamental human rights that our parents denied us, and to finally own
what is rightfully ours for the taking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 535 (Number of characters: 130):
We can further bolster ourselves for such necessary flashbacks by comparing “speaking up”
to going to the dentist for a toothache.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 536 (Number of characters: 125):
Unless we accept the acute pain of the dentist’s
therapeutic procedure, we will suffer chronic dental discomfit indefinitely.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 537 (Number of characters: 75):
Unless we speak up,
the loneliness of our silence will imprison us forever.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 538 (Number of characters: 135):
Recovering from overwhelmingly painful childhoods is also so difficult because we
understandably want to avoid any further pain at all.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 539 (Number of characters: 401):
We may even believe that we need to risk a
flashback and practice speaking up. But at the moment of facing the triggering that silence can so
easily avoid, we cannot sometimes help giving up and remaining mute. However, if we are ever to recover our real voice, we must sometimes invoke the energy of
bravery. Bravery is, in my opinion, defined by fear. It is taking right action despite being afraid.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 540 (Number of characters: 48):
It is not brave to do things that are not scary.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 541 (Number of characters: 73):
The anger work described in chapter 11 can help you with this enormously.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 542 (Number of characters: 141):
With a strong
enough intention you can begin by occasionally invoking the kind of courage that involves
feeling the fear and doing it anyway.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 543 (Number of characters: 254):
You can nudge yourself to do it to rescue your inner child
from the loneliness of never being seen or heard. Moreover, when we embrace this practice we will eventually learn that fear does not have
to disabling. We can be afraid and still act powerfully.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 544 (Number of characters: 135):
We can refuse to tolerate never speaking
up, never having our say, never stating a preference, and never saying “no” to set a boundary.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 545 (Number of characters: 166):
With enough practice, therapeutic flashbacks not only diminish, but begin to be replaced by
a healthy sense of pride in ourselves for our courageous self-championing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 546 (Number of characters: 486):
More and more we
are rewarded with feelings of safe belonging in the world. It is crucial for deeper level recovery that we learn that feelings of fear, shame and guilt are
sometimes signs that we have said or done the right thing. They are emotional flashbacks to how
we were traumatized for trying to claim normal human privileges. As our recovery progresses, we need to learn to endure these feelings. Reinterpreting the
deeper meaning of these feelings is key to accomplishing this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 547 (Number of characters: 54):
Typically this involves epiphanies
like the following.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 548 (Number of characters: 389):
“I feel afraid now, but I am not in danger like I was as a child.” “I feel guilty
not because I am guilty, but because I was intimidated into feeling guilty for expressing my
opinions, my needs and my preferences.” “I feel shame because my parents rained disgust on me
for being me. I say no to these toxic parental curses, and I am proud and right to see how they
tried to murder my soul.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 549 (Number of characters: 198):
I give them their shame back as disgust – the disgust any healthy adult

feels when he sees a parent bullying a child with contempt, or when he sees a parent heartlessly
ignoring a suffering child.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 550 (Number of characters: 738):
Optimal Stress
The quest to ongoingly grow and evolve out of my childhood trauma sometimes becomes more
embraceable to me when I remember the poet’s words: “He not busy being born is busy dying.” In fact, some of the latest research in neuroscience suggests that we actually need a modicum of
stress in our life. This type of stress is called optimal stress. Optimal stress is the balanced, moderate amount of stress that appears to be necessary to
grow the new neurons and neuronal connections that correlate with keeping the brain healthy. Research shows that just as too much stress creates a biochemical condition that damages
neurons in the brain, too little stress leads to the atrophy, death and lack of replacement of old
neurons.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 551 (Number of characters: 196):
This is why lifelong learning is widely recognized as one of the key practices necessary
to avoid Alzheimer’s disease. In my opinion, lifelong recovering is an exalted subset of lifelong learning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 552 (Number of characters: 122):
I believe that
optimal stress is frequently attained when we practice the behaviors that remedy our
developmental arrests.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 553 (Number of characters: 241):
Examples of this include reading self-help books, attending self-
improvement workshops, working at deeper self-discovery through journaling, or struggling to
be more vulnerable and authentic in a therapy session or an evolving relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 554 (Number of characters: 81):
Moreover, it
might be that minor flashbacks sometimes function as optimal stress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 555 (Number of characters: 112):
I certainly know a number
of long term recoverees who seem to be evolving and becoming sharper in their old age.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 556 (Number of characters: 675):
SILVER LININGS We live in an emotionally impoverished culture, and those who stick with a long term recovery
process are often rewarded with emotional intelligence far beyond the norm. This is somewhat
paradoxical, as survivors of childhood trauma are initially injured more grievously in their
emotional natures than those in the general population. The silver lining in this, however, is that many of us were forced to consciously address our
suffering because our wounding was so much more severe. Those who work an effective
recovery program not only recover significantly from emotional damage, but also evolve out of
the emotional impoverishment of the general society.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 557 (Number of characters: 377):
One of my clients described this as
becoming “way more emotionally intelligent than the ‘normies’.” Perhaps the greatest reward of improved emotional intelligence is seen in a greater capacity
for deeper intimacy. Emotional intelligence is a foundational ingredient of relational intelligence
– a type of intelligence that is also frequently diminished in the general populace.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 558 (Number of characters: 200):
As stated earlier, intimacy is greatly enhanced when two people dialogue about all aspects
of their experience. This is especially true when they transcend taboos against full emotional
communication.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 559 (Number of characters: 285):
Feelings of love, appreciation and gratitude are naturally enhanced when we
reciprocally show our full selves - confident or afraid, loving or alienated, proud or embarrassed. What an incredible achievement it is when any two of us create such an authentic and supportive
relationship!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 560 (Number of characters: 815):
Many of the most intimate relationships that I have seen are between people who
have done a great deal of freeing themselves from the negative legacies of their upbringings. “The Unexamined Life Is Not Worth Living”
A further silver lining in recovery is the attainment of a much richer internal life. The
introspective process, so fundamental to effective recovery work, eventually deepens and
enriches survivors’ psyches. Ongoing mindful exploration of all aspects of our experience helps
us see firsthand what Socrates meant when he said: “The unexamined life is not worth living”. The survivor who follows the introspective “road less travelled” becomes increasingly free
of compulsive and unconscious allegiance to unhelpful familial, religious and societal values that
were instilled at an impressionable age.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 561 (Number of characters: 366):
The recoveree now gets to choose her own values and reject those that are not in her own
best interest. She develops a deeper more grounded self-respect that is not contingent upon going
with the herd and shifting center with every new popular trend. In psychological parlance, she
becomes free and brave enough to individuate and develop more of her full potential.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 562 (Number of characters: 75):
In Joseph Campbell’s words, the survivor learns to “follows his own bliss”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 563 (Number of characters: 217):
He is freer to
pursue activities and interests that naturally appeal to him. He evolves into his own sense of
style. He may even feel emboldened to coif and dress himself without adherence to the standards
of fashion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 564 (Number of characters: 47):
He may extend this freedom into his home décor.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 565 (Number of characters: 129):
In this vein, I have seen many
survivors discover their own aesthetic, as well as an increased appreciation of beauty in general.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 566 (Number of characters: 195):
How this contrasts with many of the homes of my “normal” sports-buddies, whose homes are
often sparsely decorated, as if they are too afraid to put something out or up lest it not be cool
enough.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 567 (Number of characters: 611):
As the survivor recovers the right of free choice, she becomes more open to trying new
things – healthy things that mainstream society might consider uncool or even taboo. Here are
some examples of this that I believe are conducive to both recovery and healthy everyday living:
voluntary simplicity, improved diet, meditation, alternative medicine, broad scale compassion,
environmentalism, deeper emotional communication and a broader use of the grieving process. The survivor who pursues long-term development on his journey of recovering generally
achieves greater overall evolution than the average citizen.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 568 (Number of characters: 160):
For many untraumatized people, the
pursuit of ongoing learning often stops after their last formal learning experience – whether that
is high school or college.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 569 (Number of characters: 119):
Introspective development also rewards the recoveree with more perspective and wisdom in
making important life choices.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 570 (Number of characters: 122):
It also improves his everyday instinctual choices, such as whether
to fight, flee, freeze or fawn in times of real danger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 571 (Number of characters: 663):
Finally, another silver lining, often achieved in later stage recovery, is a greater ability to handle
normal pain in the most healthy and least retraumatizing way. By normal pain, I mean the
recurring existential pain all human beings experience from time to time via encounters with
loss, illness, money troubles, time pressures, etc. Such painful encounters can produce emotional
reactions like anger, sadness, fear and depression. The average person has not learned how to
verbally ventilate and metabolize their feelings about such events. This results in them getting
stuck in painful emotional places, especially depression, for inordinate amounts of time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 572 (Number of characters: 396):
The Emotional Imperialism Of “Don’t Worry, Be Happy”
One reason that recovering survivors attain greater emotional intelligence is that they eventually
see through the mainstream media’s indoctrination that people should be happy all the time. Much of the general populace, however, becomes increasingly dissociated from their full
emotional experience by anxiously pushing to pump up their mood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 573 (Number of characters: 490):
Many “normal” people strive
to fulfill the pursuit of happiness as if it were a patriotic duty. More and more they employ
socially acceptable addictions to accomplish this. Snacking, spending, self-medicating, and
online puttering are widespread addictions that seem to be ever on the rise. A particularly rampant example of unhealthy mood-altering behavior is porn addiction. Addiction to pornography creates a terrible narrowing of consciousness in the many men who are
afflicted with it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 574 (Number of characters: 485):
It commonly destroys their capacity for real intimacy. Tragically, the use of
porn is more and more “normalized”, even in many psychological circles. Here 
are 
two 
enlightening 
references 
on 
this

and

As we become more emotionally intelligent, we free ourselves from the hysteria-inducing
pressure to continuously pump up the joy in our life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 575 (Number of characters: 510):
Please do not read this as an “Ode against Joy”. It is a blessing to have our natural fair share
of laughter and feeling good. But I believe it also a blessing to resist the growing emotional
imperialism that demands we become fountains of joy. We are assaulted daily with messages
from advertisements, from laugh track-saturated TV shows, and from new age enlightenment
gurus who shame us into believing that we are “less than”, if we are not constantly bubbling over
with ecstatic Disneyland-like enthusiasm.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 576 (Number of characters: 422):
The pressure to be always up was an enormous shame trigger for me for decades. Sadly, I
increasingly see clients and friends struggling with self-contempt for not being happy enough. Once again, I am certainly not knocking joy, but when it is inauthentic, it is disconcertingly
sad and sometimes alienating. In worst case scenarios, a controlling narcissist can emotionally
blackmail us to join him in falsely emoting joy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 577 (Number of characters: 292):
Just as painful is when we codependents force
ourselves to laugh to cover up our fear or shame. This is also not to say that authentic joy cannot be contagious. Contagious joy is the
wonderful experience of being positively triggered into vicariously sharing someone else’s
authentic delight.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 578 (Number of characters: 632):
[For an experience of this, go to www.youtube.com and search for
“Quadruplets Laughing”]. In my experience, it seems that authentic joy is much more common in the lives of well
parented children. I also do not think that joy is typically as dominant an emotional theme in
adult life unless it is synthetically induced with drugs or alcohol. On the other hand, experiences
of joy for survivors can gradually become more frequent as a person’s recovery efforts promote
increasing feelings of safety in the world. As our emotional intelligence increases, I see considerable evidence that our expectations of
joy become more reasonable.

This allows us to let go of permanent happiness as the unrealistic

goal of recovery.

Until this happens, we remain at the mercy of the critic’s contemptuous
diatribes that we are not being joyful enough.

One of my clients recently became mindful enough

chunk 582 (Number of characters: 619):
As a concluding comment to this overview, it is important to emphasize that, like most things in
life, there are degrees of Cptsd. The continuum of Cptsd ranges from mild neurosis to psychosis,
and from highly functioning to non-functioning. Its severity ranges from having extended
periods without flashbacks to being in full flashback horror much of the time. This range also
varies from a condition of increased experiences of thriving to a condition of barely surviving
disability. Progress in recovery is seen, then, in flashbacks becoming more manageable and life
satisfaction becoming continuously more frequent.

chunk 583 (Number of characters: 101):
A friend of mine once joked with me: “I’ve
got so much recovery, I’m beyond normal – I’m supernormal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 584 (Number of characters: 350):
I make the normies look like
they’re the ones with Cptsd.” As we end the overview, we are ready to move to the next chapter, which explains how varying
childhood trauma histories can cause Cptsd. Here we will also see how verbal and emotional
abuse alone can cause Cptsd, and how profound emotional abandonment is typically at the core
of most Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 585 (Number of characters: 528):
PART II
THE FINE POINTS OF RECOVERING

WHAT IF I WAS NEVER HIT? Physical and sexual abuse are the most obvious traumas that a child can experience, especially
when they are ongoing. However, much that is also traumatic goes unnoticed in Cptsd-
engendering families. This often occurs because parental acts of physical abuse are more blatant
than acts of verbal and emotional abuse and neglect. It appears to me that just as many children
acquire Cptsd from emotionally traumatizing families as from physically traumatizing ones.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 586 (Number of characters: 414):
Denial about the traumatic effects of childhood abandonment can seriously hamper your
ability to recover. In childhood, ongoing emotional neglect typically creates overwhelming
feelings of fear, shame and emptiness. As an adult survivor, you may continuously flashback into
this abandonment mélange. Recovering depends on realizing that fear, shame and depression are
the lingering effects of a loveless childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 587 (Number of characters: 142):
Without such understanding, your crucial, unmet
needs for comforting human connection can strand you in a great deal of unnecessary suffering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 588 (Number of characters: 60):
Denial And Minimization
Confronting denial is no small task.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 589 (Number of characters: 158):
Children so need to believe that their parents love and care
for them, that they will deny and minimize away evidence of the most egregious neglect and
abuse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 590 (Number of characters: 466):
De-minimization is a crucial aspect of confronting denial. It is the process by which a
person deconstructs the defense of “making light” of his childhood trauma. The lifelong process
of de-minimizing the impact of childhood trauma is like peeling a very slippery and caustic
onion. The outer layer for some is the stark physical evidence of abuse, e.g., sexual abuse or
excessive corporal punishment. Subsequent layers involve verbal, spiritual and emotional abuse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 591 (Number of characters: 660):
Core layers have to do with verbal, spiritual and emotional neglect. In a perversely ironic way, my parents’ physical abuse of me was a blessing, for it was so
blatant that my attempts to suppress, rationalize, make light of and laugh it off lost their power in

adolescence, and I was able to see my father for the bully that he was. [Seeing my idealized
mother’s abusiveness came much later]. Identifying my father’s behavior as abusive eventually helped me become aware of less
blatant aspects of my parents’ oppression, and I subsequently discovered the verbal and
emotional abuse layer of the onion of my childhood abandonment. Verbal And Emotional Abuse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 592 (Number of characters: 303):
The fact that verbal and emotional abuse can be traumatic is lost on many childhood trauma
victims, though it is rarely lost on recovering victims of cult brainwashing who also are prone to
developing Cptsd. Many survivors of verbal and emotional abuse never learn to validate its soul-damaging
effects.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 593 (Number of characters: 58):
They never accurately assign current time suffering to it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 594 (Number of characters: 694):
Attempts to acknowledge it are
typically blindsided with thoughts that it was nothing compared to kids who were repeatedly
beaten – who “had it so much worse.” As a child, I minimized my father’s frequent face-slapping
by comparing it to my friend’s father who used to punch him. Much later, however, I finally realized that for me, and many of my clients, verbal and
emotional abuse damaged us much more than our physical abuse. Ongoing assault with critical words systematically destroys our self-esteem and replaces it
with a toxic inner critic that incessantly judges us as defective. Even worse, words that are
emotionally poisoned with contempt infuse the child with fear and toxic shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 595 (Number of characters: 628):
Fear and shame
condition him to refrain from asking for attention, from expressing himself in ways that draw
attention. Before long, he learns to refrain from seeking any kind of help or connection at all. Theoretical Neurobiology Of The Critic
Unrelenting criticism, especially when it is ground in with parental rage and scorn, is so injurious
that it changes the structure of the child’s brain. Repeated messages of disdain are internalized and adopted by the child, who eventually
repeats them over and over to himself. Incessant repetitions result in the construction of thick
neural pathways of self-hate and self-disgust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 596 (Number of characters: 373):
Over time a self-hate response attaches to more and
more of the child’s thoughts, feelings and behaviors. Eventually, any inclination toward authentic or vulnerable self-expression activates internal
neural networks of self-loathing. The child is forced to exist in a crippling state of self-attack,
which eventually becomes the equivalent of full-fledged self-abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 597 (Number of characters: 76):
The ability to
support himself or take his own side in any way is decimated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 598 (Number of characters: 155):
With ongoing parental reinforcement, these neural pathways expand into a large complex
network that becomes an Inner Critic that dominates mental activity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 599 (Number of characters: 94):
The inner critic’s negative
perspective creates many programs of self-rejecting perfectionism.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 600 (Number of characters: 74):
At the same time, it obsesses
about danger and catastrophizes incessantly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 601 (Number of characters: 85):
Chapters 9 and 10 expand on shrinking and
deconstructing these life-ruining programs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 602 (Number of characters: 116):
Until this is accomplished, the survivor typically
lives in varying degrees of emotional flashback much of the time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 603 (Number of characters: 86):
The verbal and emotional layer of the abuse onion has many sub-layers of minimization.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 604 (Number of characters: 192):
I
have heard clients jokingly repeat numerous versions of this over and over: “I know I’m hard on

myself, but if I don’t constantly kick my own ass, I’ll be more of a loser than I already am.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 605 (Number of characters: 82):
In
fact, I really need you to come down on me if I try to get away with anything!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 606 (Number of characters: 329):
A childhood rife
with verbal and emotional abuse forces the child to so thoroughly identify with the critic, that it
is as if the critic is his whole identity. Disidentification from the critic is the fight of a lifetime. To liberate your identity from the
toxic critic, you will have to repetitively confront it for a long time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 607 (Number of characters: 134):
You will have greater
success if you are prepared to forgive yourself for repeatedly collapsing back into the old habit of
self-blame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 608 (Number of characters: 52):
Progress is always a gradual back and forth process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 609 (Number of characters: 555):
Ironically, a pernicious type of
self-hate can constellate around the self-judgment that one is especially defective because she
cannot simply banish the critic. This is the typical toxic, all-or-none thinking of the critic. Sadly, many survivors give up on fighting the critic before recognizing the myriad subtle
ways it tortures them. Yet, there is no more noble recovery battle than that which gradually frees
the psyche from critic dominance. Until this happens to a significant degree, there is minimal
development of the healthy, user-friendly ego.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 610 (Number of characters: 619):
Let us look now at how emotional neglect alone can create a psyche-dominating critic. Emotional Neglect: The Core Wound In Complex PTSD
Minimization about the damage caused by extensive emotional neglect is at the core of the Cptsd
denial onion. Our journey of recovering takes a quantum leap when we really feel and
understand how devastating it was to be emotionally abandoned. An absence of parental loving
interest and engagement, especially in the first few years, creates an overwhelming emptiness. Life feels harrowingly frightening to the infant or toddler who is left for long periods without
comfort and care.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 611 (Number of characters: 286):
Children are helpless and powerless for a long time, and when they sense that
no one has their back, they feel scared, miserable and disheartened. Much of the constant anxiety
that adult survivors live in is this still aching fear that comes from having been so frighteningly
abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 612 (Number of characters: 597):
Many survivors never discover and work through the wounds that correlate with this level. This happens because they over-assign their suffering to overt abuse and never get to the core
issue of their emotional abandonment. As stated above, this is especially likely to occur with
survivors who dismissively compare their trauma to those who were abused more noticeably and
more dramatically. I find this painfully ironic because some people suffer significant active
abuse without developing Cptsd. Typically, they are “spared” because there is one caretaker who
does not emotionally neglect them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 613 (Number of characters: 129):
Traumatic emotional neglect occurs when a child does not have a single caretaker to whom
she can turn in times of need or danger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 614 (Number of characters: 67):
Cptsd then sets in to the degree that there is no
alternative adult

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 615 (Number of characters: 86):
[relative, older sibling, neighbor, or teacher] to turn to for comfort and
protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 616 (Number of characters: 433):
This is especially true when the abandonment occurs 24/7, 365 days a year for the
first few years. Growing up emotionally neglected is like nearly dying of thirst outside the fenced off
fountain of a parent’s warmth and interest. Emotional neglect makes children feel worthless,
unlovable and excruciatingly empty. It leaves them with a hunger that gnaws deeply at the center
of their being. They starve for human warmth and comfort.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 617 (Number of characters: 370):
The Failure To Thrive Syndrome
When a child is continuously deprived of a nurturing caretaker, love-starvation steadily increases
and sometimes devolves into the Failure to Thrive Syndrome. Failure to thrive is a term coined in the mid twentieth century to describe the epidemic of
baby deaths that occurred when new germ-phobic practices were introduced into hospitals.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 618 (Number of characters: 100):
The
new standard was that nurses were prohibited from holding babies for fear of contaminating
them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 619 (Number of characters: 44):
Infant mortality immediately began to climb.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 620 (Number of characters: 104):
Modern medical practice has abandoned this heartless approach because of the Failure to
thrive research.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 621 (Number of characters: 162):
This research has since been corroborated by data from Eastern European
orphanages where there are insufficient staff to meet the contact-comfort needs of babies.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 622 (Number of characters: 142):
Modern medicine now accepts as scientific fact the principle that babies need a great deal of
physical touch and nurturing in order to thrive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 623 (Number of characters: 149):
In my experience, failure to thrive is not an all-or-none phenomenon, but rather a
continuum that stretches from the abandonment depression to death.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 624 (Number of characters: 268):
Many Cptsd survivors never
thrived as babies. I believe that many suffered painful bouts of lingering near the end of the
continuum that feels death-like. Several of my clients commonly have quipped that they “feel
like death warmed over” when they are in a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 625 (Number of characters: 162):
Moreover, I suspect that some traumatized children do die from their abandonment. Perhaps, their immune systems weaken and make them more susceptible to diseases.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 626 (Number of characters: 114):
Perhaps, as
David Kalshed hints, they unconsciously gravitate toward lethal “accidents” to terminate their
misery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 627 (Number of characters: 262):
One of my clients reported this painful memory when we were processing a flashback that
she was trapped in. She was ten, in a daze, and walked out between two parked cars into traffic. She was hit by a truck and it took months of hospitalization to save her leg.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 628 (Number of characters: 747):
Her most tearful re-
experiencing of this event was remembering how she woke up in the hospital and felt
tremendous disappointment that she was still alive. Emotional Hunger And Addiction
The emotional hunger that comes from parental abandonment often morphs over time into an
insatiable appetite for substances and/or addictive processes. Minimization of early abandonment
often transforms later in life into the minimizing that some survivors use to rationalize their
substance and process addictions. Fortunately, many survivors eventually come to see their
substance or process addictions as problematic. But many also minimize the deleterious effects
of their addiction and jokingly dismiss their need to end or reduce their reliance on them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 629 (Number of characters: 291):
When the survivor has no understanding of the effects of trauma or no memory of being
traumatized, addictions are often understandable, misplaced attempts to regulate painful
emotional flashbacks. However many survivors are now in a position to see how self-destructive
their addictions are.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 630 (Number of characters: 65):
They are now old enough to learn healthier ways of self-soothing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 631 (Number of characters: 378):
Accordingly, substance and process addictions can be seen as misguided attempts to distract
from inner pain. The desire to reduce such habits can therefore be used as motivation to learn the
more sophisticated forms of self-soothing that Cptsd recovery work has to offer. As we will see in chapter 11, grieving work offers us irreplaceable tools for working

through inner pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 632 (Number of characters: 79):
This then helps obviate the need to harmfully distract ourselves from our
pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 633 (Number of characters: 678):
The Evolutionary Basis Of Attachment Needs
The human brain evolved during the Hunter-Gatherer era that represents 99.8% of our time on
this planet. For a child, safety from predators during these times depended on being in very close
proximity to an adult. Even the briefest loss of contact with a parental figure could trigger
panicky feelings as beasts of prey only needed seconds to snatch away an unprotected child. Fear hard-wired in the child as a healthy response to separation from a protective adult. Fear
also linked automatically with the fight response so that the infant and toddler would
automatically cry angrily for attention, help, and cessation of abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 634 (Number of characters: 717):
Cptsd-inducing families however loathe angry crying, and many can find professionals to
back them up for routinely leaving babies and very young children to “cry it out” on their own. In most dysfunctional families, parents disdain children for needing any kind of help or
attention at all. Moreover, even the most well-intentioned parent can seriously neglect their
children by subscribing to the egregious 20th century “wisdom” that “Kids need quality time -
quantity does not matter.” When children experience long periods of being powerless to obtain needed connection
with a parent, they become increasingly anxious, upset and depressed. In Cptsd-engendering
families, the absence of care and concern is extreme.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 635 (Number of characters: 76):
A caretaker is rarely or never available for
support, comfort or protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 636 (Number of characters: 274):
If this is what you suffered, you then grew up feeling that no one likes you. No one ever
listened to you or seemed to want you around. No one had empathy for you, showed you
warmth, or invited closeness. No one cared about what you thought, felt, did, wanted or dreamed
of.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 637 (Number of characters: 665):
You learned early that, no matter how hurt, alienated, or terrified you were, turning to a
parent would do nothing more than exacerbate your experience of rejection. When caretakers turn their backs on a child’s need for help and support, her inner world
becomes an increasingly nightmarish amalgam of fear, shame and depression. The child who is
abandoned in this way experiences the world as a terrifying place. Over time the child’s dominant experience of herself is so replete with emotional pain and
so unmanageable that that she has to dissociate, self-medicate, act out [aggression against others]
or act in [aggression against the self] to distract from it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 638 (Number of characters: 698):
The situation of the abandoned child further deteriorates as an extended absence of warmth
and protection gives rise to the cancerous growth of the inner critic as described above. The child
projects his hope for being accepted onto self-perfection. By the time the child is becoming self-
reflective, cognitions start to arise that sound like this: “I’m so despicable, worthless, unlovable,
and ugly; maybe my parents would love me if I could make myself like those perfect kids I see
on TV.” In this way, the child becomes hyperaware of imperfections and strives to become flawless. Eventually she roots out the ultimate flaw – the mortal sin of wanting or asking for her parents’
time or energy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 639 (Number of characters: 330):
Intrinsic to this process is noticing – more and more hyper-vigilantly - how her
parents turn their back or become angry or disgusted whenever she needs anything, whether it be
attention, listening, interest, or affection. Emotional neglect, alone, causes children to abandon themselves, and to give up on the
formation of a self.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 640 (Number of characters: 141):
They do so to preserve an illusion of connection with the parent and to
protect themselves from the danger of losing that tenuous connection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 641 (Number of characters: 158):
This typically requires a
great deal of self-abdication, e.g., the forfeiture of self-esteem, self-confidence, self-care, self-
interest, and self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 642 (Number of characters: 196):
Moreover, endangerment programs proliferate in the critic as the child learns that he cannot
ask his parent to protect him from dangers and injustices in the outside world, never mind in the
home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 643 (Number of characters: 76):
His only recourse is to become hypervigilant about things that can go wrong.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 644 (Number of characters: 111):
His critic
compiles lists of possible calamities, especially those that are graphically portrayed in the media.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 645 (Number of characters: 168):
The media gives the critic of the abandoned child much fodder to play with. She may be
exposed daily to hours of programs that glorify sarcasm, backbiting and bullying.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 646 (Number of characters: 152):
Moreover
news programs, with a ninety percent content of bad news, fill her head with impressions that the
world is predominantly hostile and dangerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 647 (Number of characters: 706):
Even worse, emotionally neglectful parents
commonly abandon their children to their favorite babysitter – the TV. Through such neglect the child’s consciousness eventually becomes overwhelmed with the
processes of drasticizing and catastrophizing. Drasticizing and catastrophizing are critic
processes that lead the child to constantly rehearse fearful scenarios in a vain attempt to prepare
himself for the worst. This is the process by which Cptsd with its overdeveloped stress and toxic
shame programs sets in and becomes triggerable by a plethora of normally innocuous stimuli. Most notable of these stimuli are other people, especially unknown people or people even
vaguely reminiscent of the parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 648 (Number of characters: 496):
Over time, the critic comes to assume that all other people
are dangerous and automatically triggers the fight, flight, freeze or fawn response whenever a
stranger or unproven other comes into view. This people-are-dangerous process typically devolves into the social anxiety that is
frequently a symptom of Cptsd. In worst case scenarios it manifests as social phobia and
agoraphobia. In my opinion, agoraphobia is rarely the fear of open spaces. It is instead a
disguised form of social phobia.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 649 (Number of characters: 64):
It is the fear of going out lest you run into someone or anyone.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 650 (Number of characters: 219):
Abandonment Stultifies Emotional And Relational Intelligence
As stated above, emotionally abandoned children often devolve into experiencing all people as
dangerous, no matter how benign or generous they may in fact be.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 651 (Number of characters: 78):
Even love, coming their way,
reverberates threateningly on a subliminal level.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 652 (Number of characters: 196):
Unconsciously, they fear that if they
momentarily “trick” someone into liking them, the forbidden prize will vanish once their social
perfectionism inevitably fails and exposes their unworthiness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 653 (Number of characters: 97):
Moreover, when this occurs, they
will be triggered even more deeply into the abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 654 (Number of characters: 323):
Emotional intelligence and its cohort, relational intelligence, are forced into developmental
arrest by abandoning parents. Children never learn that a relationship with a healthy person can
be comforting and enriching. The ability to open to and benefit from love and caring from others
often lays dormant and undeveloped.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 655 (Number of characters: 138):
Moreover, the appropriate management of the normal emotions that recurrently arise in
significant relationships is never modeled for them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 656 (Number of characters: 440):
Emotional intelligence about the healthy and
functional aspects of anger, sadness, and fear lies fallow. De-Minimizing Emotional Abandonment
As with physical abuse, effective work on the wounds of verbal and emotional abuse can
sometimes open the door to de-minimizing the awful impact of emotional neglect. I sometimes
feel the most for my clients who were “only” neglected, because it is so difficult to see neglect as
hard core evidence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 657 (Number of characters: 60):
Most people remember little before they were four years old.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 658 (Number of characters: 54):
And by that
time, much of this kind of damage is done.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 659 (Number of characters: 162):
It typically takes some very deep introspective work,
to realize that current time flashback pain is a re-creation of how bad it felt to be emotionally
abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 660 (Number of characters: 90):
The remembering and de-minimizing of the impact of emotional neglect can take a long
time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 661 (Number of characters: 64):
It is typically an intuitive piecing together of a lot of clues.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 662 (Number of characters: 582):
The puzzle is often solved when
a critical mass of childhood reconstruction is reached. Sometimes this fosters an epiphany that
neglect is indeed at the core of present time suffering. Sometimes this epiphany brings a great
relieving certainty that fragile self-esteem, frequent flashbacks, and recurring reenactments of
unsupportive relationships were caused by the closed hearts of your parents. I sometimes regret that I did not know what I now know about this kind of neglect when I
wrote my first book. I wish I had not over-focused on the role of abuse in my childhood trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 663 (Number of characters: 180):
It is so hard to convey this to a client whose critic minimizes and shames them for their plight by
comparing them unfavorably to me: “I didn’t have it anywhere near as bad as you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 664 (Number of characters: 24):
My mother
never hit me!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 665 (Number of characters: 780):
How ironic that this typically invokes a feeling-sense in me that the worst thing that
happened to me, by far, was growing up so emotionally abandoned. In fact, it was not until I
learned to assign the pain of numerous current time emotional flashbacks to the abject loneliness
of my childhood, that I was able to work effectively on the repetition compulsion that lead me
into so many neglectful relationships. And once again this is not to deny or minimize the C-ptsd-inducing traumatization that does
come from each and every type of abuse; physical, sexual, verbal and emotional. Practicing Vulnerability
Emotional abandonment is healed by the type of real intimacy that we have been discussing. And
once again real intimacy depends on us showing up in times of vulnerability.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 666 (Number of characters: 192):
Deep-level
recovering occurs when we successfully connect with a safe enough other during the
flashbacked-times of feeling trapped in the fear, shame and depression of the abandonment
mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 667 (Number of characters: 78):
In this vein, I had to painstakingly practice showing up in my pain for years.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 668 (Number of characters: 43):
At first I could only
do this infrequently.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 669 (Number of characters: 151):
I was too habituated to my childhood default positions of hiding or
camouflaging with substances whenever I was in the grip of the abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 670 (Number of characters: 132):
Yet I
drew strength to increase my practice from a growing distaste for the social perfectionism of my
people-pleasing codependence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 671 (Number of characters: 184):
I somehow knew my loneliness would never decrease unless I
took the risk to see if certain well chosen others would accept me in all aspects of my experience,

not just the shiny ones.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 672 (Number of characters: 135):
And of course, like most survivors, I was ignorant at first that I was even experiencing the
emotional pain of the abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 673 (Number of characters: 353):
How could I help but conceal it? Moreover, even after considerable de-minimization of my childhood abuse/neglect picture,
I was still convinced that everyone but my therapist would find me abhorrent if I shared about
my flashback feelings. Furthermore, my trust of my therapist also wavered quite a bit at first,
especially during my deepest flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 674 (Number of characters: 277):
Gratefully, sufficient positive experiences with my therapist eventually emboldened me to
bring my authentic vulnerability to other select and gradually proven relationships, where I found
the acceptance, safety and support that, previously, I would not have known to wish for.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 675 (Number of characters: 50):
There are limitations of the analogy of the onion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 676 (Number of characters: 81):
Later recovery does typically involve working
at various levels at the same time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 677 (Number of characters: 38):
De-minimization is a lifetime process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 678 (Number of characters: 292):
Revisiting a central
issue of our abandonment picture sometimes impacts us even more deeply than it did at first. One such occasion left me reeling with the certain knowledge that getting hit felt preferable
to being abandoned for long hours outside my depressed mother’s locked bedroom door.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 679 (Number of characters: 107):
I would
pound on the door even though I knew she would explode because I just could not bear the
isolation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 680 (Number of characters: 607):
I have known about the latter for quite some time now and yet writing about it brings
up some new bitter-sweet tears. Bitter-sweet tears are not uncommon in the ongoing work of peeling the layers of the denial
onion. The tears are bitter because we realize the abandonment was even more devastating than
we previously realized. And then the tears are sweet because they validate the truth of the
recollection and put the blame where it truly belongs. And then they may be bitter again because
the horrible abandonments happened over and over again when we were so young and
legitimately needed so much help.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 681 (Number of characters: 889):
And then they can turn sweet again, as in tears of gratitude,
because a person often comes through this kind of depth work with an enhanced compassion for
what she suffered and a healthy pride about having survived. In my latest experience of this type of grieving my sweet tears came from realizing that I do
regularly experience good enough love and safety in relationship. And then my tears were bitter
again because I can still emotionally flashback to that bereft state of feeling stranded from the
comfort of others, even occasionally from my wife and son. And then my tears were sweet again
because my flashbacks are so much easier to handle these days, especially as I increasingly
master the use of the tools I describe in chapter 8. The Power Of Narrative
There is also growing evidence that recovery from Complex PTSD is reflected in the narrative a
person tells about her life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 682 (Number of characters: 355):
The degree of recovery matches the degree to which a survivor’s story
is complete, coherent, and emotionally congruent and told from a self-sympathetic perspective. In my experience, deep level recovery is often reflected in a narrative that highlights the
role of emotional neglect in describing what one has suffered and what one continues to deal
with.

chunk 683 (Number of characters: 108):
My client, Matt, peeled a large layer off his onion of denial and minimization two days
before Mother’s Day.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 684 (Number of characters: 49):
He came into his session in a terrible flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 685 (Number of characters: 33):
“Life sucks and I suck
even more.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 686 (Number of characters: 621):
I couldn’t even do something as simple as pick out a Mother’s Day card.” Fortunately, Matt had achieved a great deal of de-minimization since the previous Mother’s
Day when he thought his mother was a good mother because she had never hit him. Now
however, he was heavily triggered by spending an hour in a card shop unable to find a card that
he could send to his mother. As we explored this further, we discovered that the sentiments
written in every card made him feel like he would be betraying his inner child if he sent it. “I tell you, Pete, not one of those cards describes something that I could be grateful for.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 687 (Number of characters: 70):
I
don’t have one memory of anything nice she ever said or did for me!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 688 (Number of characters: 98):
Before long, he was deep
into grieving about how little mothering he had received from his mother.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 689 (Number of characters: 125):
He cried and angered about the scornful look and the sarcastic tone of voice that so
characterized his interactions with her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 690 (Number of characters: 327):
“Why did I have to get such a bad deal from the
mothering deck?!” Towards the end of the session, as often happens with healthy grieving, he felt his flashback
resolve and was restored to feeling like he was once again on his own side. The relief of being
out of the flashback also allowed his healthy sense of humor to return.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 691 (Number of characters: 84):
He started riffing: “I’m going to start a greeting card business for people like me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 692 (Number of characters: 72):
I’m going
to make a line of cards for people with dysfunctional mothers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 693 (Number of characters: 15):
How about this?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 694 (Number of characters: 943):
‘Thanks Mom
for never knowing what grade I was in’; or ‘Thanks Mom for all the memories of you walking
away whenever I was hurting’; or ‘Thanks Mom for teaching me how to only notice what was
wrong me’; or ‘Thanks Mom for teaching me how to frown at myself in self-disgust.’”
Understanding how profoundly derelict your parents were in their duty to nurture and protect you
is a master key to your recovery. You will benefit greatly from seeing emotional flashbacks as
direct messages from your child-self about how much your parents rejected you. When denial is
significantly deconstructed, you will typically feel genuine compassion for the child that you
were. This self-compassion assuages emotional neglect by providing you with the missed
childhood experience of receiving empathy in painful emotional states instead of contempt or
abandonment. This, then, helps you to reverse the childhood-survival habit of automatic self-
abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 695 (Number of characters: 695):
In turn, this can further motivate you to identify and address the many ways you
were abused and/or neglected. Chapter 8 of my book, The Tao of Fully Feeling, provides detailed
guidelines for assessing and remediating your abuse/neglect picture. Finally, it is an empowering accomplishment to really get the profound significance of childhood
emotional neglect. It is often flashback-resolving to realize in the moment that a flashback into
bewilderment and hopelessness is an emotional reliving of your childhood trauma. Like nothing
else, this can generate a self-protective impulse toward your child-self and your present-time self,
kick-starting the process of resolving any given flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 696 (Number of characters: 491):
WHAT IS MY TRAUMA TYPE? This chapter describes a trauma typology for recognizing and recovering from the different types
of Cptsd. We human beings respond with some variability to childhood trauma. This model
elaborates four basic survival strategies and defensive styles that develop out of our instinctive
Fight, Flight, Freeze and Fawn responses. Variances in your childhood abuse/neglect pattern, birth order and genetics result in you
gravitating toward a specific 4F survival strategy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 697 (Number of characters: 237):
You do this as a child to prevent, escape or
ameliorate further traumatization. Fight types develop a narcissistic-like defense. Flight types
develop an obsessive/compulsive-like defense. Freeze types develop a dissociative-like defense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 698 (Number of characters: 46):
Fawn types develop a codependent-like defense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 699 (Number of characters: 687):
Healthy Employment Of The 4 F’s
People who experience “good enough parenting” in childhood arrive in adulthood with a healthy
and flexible response repertoire to danger. In the face of real danger, they have appropriate
access to all of their 4F choices. Easy access to the fight response insures good boundaries, healthy assertiveness and
aggressive self-protectiveness if necessary. Untraumatized people also easily and appropriately access their flight instinct and
disengage and retreat when confrontation would exacerbate their danger. Untraumatized people also freeze appropriately and give up and quit struggling when
further activity or resistance is futile or counterproductive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 700 (Number of characters: 236):
Additionally, the freeze response is
sometimes our first response to danger, as when we become still, quiet and camouflaged to buy
time, to assess the danger and decide whether fight, flight, continued freeze or fawn is our best
option.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 701 (Number of characters: 208):
And finally, untraumatized people also fawn in a non-groveling manner and are able to

listen, help, and compromise as readily as they assert and express themselves and their needs,
rights and points of view.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 702 (Number of characters: 259):
A deeper elaboration of the origins of these four defenses is found
below and in the next chapter. POSITIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FOUR F’S
Those who are repetitively traumatized in childhood often learn to survive by over-using one or
two of the 4F Reponses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 703 (Number of characters: 158):
Fixation in any one 4F response not only limits our ability to access all
the others, but also severely impairs our ability to relax into an undefended state.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 704 (Number of characters: 73):
Additionally, it
strands us in a narrow, impoverished experience of life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 705 (Number of characters: 262):
Over time a habitual 4F defense also “serves” to distract us from the nagging voice of the
critic and the painful feelings that underlie it. Preoccupation with 4F behaviors dulls our
awareness of our unresolved past trauma and the pain of our current alienation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 706 (Number of characters: 70):
This chart compares the harmful behaviors of each defensive structure.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 707 (Number of characters: 115):
Real or imagined
danger typically triggers us into these roles and behaviors when we are in an emotional
flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 708 (Number of characters: 219):
DETRIMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE 4F DEFENSES
CPTSD AS AN ATTACHMENT DISORDER
Excessive reliance on a fight, flight, freeze or fawn response is the traumatized child’s

unconscious attempt to cope with constant danger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 709 (Number of characters: 88):
It is also a strategy to strengthen the illusion
that her parents really care about her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 710 (Number of characters: 234):
In adult life, all 4F types are commonly ambivalent about real intimacy. This is because
closeness often triggers us into painful emotional flashbacks. It reminds us of how we had to
survive without comforting connection in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 711 (Number of characters: 593):
Our 4F defenses therefore offer protection
against further re-abandonment by precluding the type of vulnerable relating that leads to deeper
bonding. A survivor also avoids vulnerable relating because his past makes him believe that he will
be attacked or abandoned as he was in childhood. This is why showing vulnerability often
triggers painful emotional flashbacks. Many fight types avoid real intimacy by alienating others with their angry and controlling
demands for unconditional love. This unrealistic demand to have their unmet childhood needs
met destroys the possibility of intimacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 712 (Number of characters: 139):
Moreover, some fight types delude themselves into
believing that they are perfect. They see the other as the one who needs to be perfected.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 713 (Number of characters: 99):
This
defensive belief then entitles them to totally blame their partners for relationship problems.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 714 (Number of characters: 100):
Many flight types stay perpetually busy and industrious to avoid being triggered by deeper
relating.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 715 (Number of characters: 98):
Others also work obsessively to perfect themselves hoping to someday become worthy
enough of love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 716 (Number of characters: 344):
Such flight types have great difficulty showing anything but their perfect
persona. Many freeze types hide away in their rooms and reveries fully convinced that the world of
relating holds nothing for them. Freeze type who have not been totally turned off relationships by
horrible childhood neglect or abuse, gravitate to online relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 717 (Number of characters: 80):
Online relating can be
pursued safely at home with as little contact as desired.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 718 (Number of characters: 199):
Many fawn types avoid emotional investment and potential disappointment by barely
showing themselves. They hide behind their helpful personas and over-listen, over-elicit and/or
overdo for the other.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 719 (Number of characters: 132):
By over-focusing on their partners, they then do not have to risk real self-
exposure and the possibility of deeper level rejection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 720 (Number of characters: 73):
This chart compares and contrasts the differences between the four types.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 721 (Number of characters: 700):
4F DISTORTIONS OF ATTACHMENT AND SAFETY INSTINCTS
Now let us examine each of the 4F defenses more closely with a view toward decreasing our
overreliance on them. THE FIGHT TYPE AND THE NARCISSISTIC DEFENSE
Fight types are unconsciously driven by the belief that power and control can create safety,
assuage abandonment and secure love. Children who are spoiled and given insufficient limits [a

uniquely painful type of abandonment] can become fight types. Children who are allowed to
imitate the bullying of a narcissistic parent may also develop a habitual fight response. Numerous fight types start out as older siblings who over-power their younger siblings just as
their parent over-powers them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 722 (Number of characters: 265):
Fight types learn to respond to their feelings of abandonment with anger. Many use
contempt, a poisonous blend of narcissistic rage and disgust, to intimidate and shame others into
mirroring them. Narcissists treat others as if they are as extensions of themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 723 (Number of characters: 439):
The entitled fight type commonly uses others as an audience for his incessant monologing. He may treat a “captured” freeze or fawn type as a slave in a dominance-submission relationship. The price of admission to a relationship with an extreme narcissist is self-annihilation. One of
my clients quipped: “Narcissists don’t have relationships; they take prisoners.” The Charming Bully
Especially devolved fight types can become sociopathic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 724 (Number of characters: 289):
Sociopathy can range along a
continuum that stretches from corrupt politician to vicious criminal. A particularly nasty
sociopath, who I call the charming bully, probably falls somewhere around the middle of this
continuum. The charming bully behaves in a friendly manner some of the time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 725 (Number of characters: 261):
He can even
occasionally listen and be helpful in small amounts, but he still uses his contempt to overpower
and control others. This type typically relies on scapegoats for the dumping of his vitriol. These unfortunate
scapegoats are typically weaker than him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 726 (Number of characters: 122):
They may be members of a disenfranchised group: the
“ethnic” employees, the gays, women, his “problem” child or wife, etc.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 727 (Number of characters: 554):
He generally spares his
favorites from this behavior, unless they get out of line. If the charming bully is charismatic enough, those close to him will often fail to register the
unconscionable meanness of his scapegoating. The bully’s favorites often slip into denial,
relieved that they are not the target. Especially charismatic bullies may even be admired and seen
as great. Being the scapegoated child or spouse of such a bully is especially problematic because
it is so difficult to get anyone to validate that you were or are being abused by them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 728 (Number of characters: 300):
I remember how perplexed I used to be at photos of Hitler ostensibly acting kindly to his
children. And I think as I write this of how many billionaires are venerated, and how most of
them stand up very poorly to closer scrutiny. So many billionaires use sociopathic tactics to
accrue their fortunes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 729 (Number of characters: 199):
Examples of this are hostile takeovers, exploitive labor policies, health
destroying work conditions, devastating environmental practices and various other forms of
cheating, lying and back-stabbing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 730 (Number of characters: 118):
The “great” icon, Henry Ford, would regularly place new young workers at the front of his
“innovative” assembly lines.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 731 (Number of characters: 123):
The tired, used-up workers further down the line who could not
then keep up were unceremoniously ushered out the back door.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 732 (Number of characters: 220):
Labor unions eventually curtailed
that practice in this country, but many jobs have since been exported to unregulated third world
countries where workers labor in the same atrocious soul- and body-destroying conditions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 733 (Number of characters: 84):
And then, on a much less grand level, I remember a best friend I had in my twenties.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 734 (Number of characters: 188):
I

thought he was a great guy for almost two years until one day, shopping in the supermarket with
him, I witnessed his demeaning lambasting of an innocent checker just out of sheer spite.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 735 (Number of characters: 191):
Other Types Of Narcissists
Rageaholic narcissists are infamous for using other people as dumping grounds for their anger. They are addicted to the emotional release of catharting in this way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 736 (Number of characters: 100):
The relief often does not last
long before they are looking for another fix of venting their spleen.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 737 (Number of characters: 182):
This type of narcissism is pure bullying, and bullying alone can cause ptsd. If it goes on
long enough as it does with bullying parents in a dysfunctional family, it can cause Cptsd.

rings a bell with you, please check out www.nobully.com .

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 739 (Number of characters: 182):
Furthermore, and closer to a key theme of this book, I report the evidence of more than a
few clients who were horribly abused by their pillar-of-the-community, narcissistic parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 740 (Number of characters: 99):
Among them is my suave silent-type father, who regularly raged at and backhanded me and my
sisters.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 741 (Number of characters: 40):
He was much admired in our neighborhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 742 (Number of characters: 201):
A final example of narcissism is the charming narcissist who is not necessarily a bully. I
call this type the narcissist in codependent clothing. My friend’s father is this type of charming
narcissist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 743 (Number of characters: 114):
When you meet him, he lures you in with questions and elicitation that make you feel
like he is interested in you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 744 (Number of characters: 113):
But, within a few minutes [once you have taken the bait], he
suddenly shifts into monologing like a filibusterer.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 745 (Number of characters: 131):
This particular type often masters the run-on
sentence and there is nary a pause to interject or even offer an excuse for escaping.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 746 (Number of characters: 80):
You have
become a captive audience and your release will not be procured easily.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 747 (Number of characters: 726):
Recovering From A Polarized Fight Response
I agree with the widely held notion that extreme narcissists and sociopaths are untreatable. Typically they are convinced that they themselves are perfect and that everyone else the problem. Fight types who are not true narcissists, however, benefit from understanding the costly
price they pay for controlling others with intimidation, criticism and sarcasm. Some who I
worked with eventually saw how their aggressive behavior scared away their potential intimates. One survivor also realized that although her partner stayed, he was so afraid and resentful of her
demandingness and irritability, that he could not manifest the warmth or real liking that she so
desperately desired.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 748 (Number of characters: 690):
I have also helped a number of fight types understand the downward spiral of power and
alienation that comes from being over-controlling. It looks like this: excessive use of power
triggers a fearful emotional withdrawal in the other, which makes the fight type feel even more
abandoned. In turn, he becomes more outraged and contemptuous, which then further distances
his “intimate”. This once again increases the fight type’s rage and disgust, which then creates
increasing distance and the withholding of warmth, ad infinitum. Fight types benefit from learning to redirect their rage toward the awful childhood
circumstances that caused them to adopt such an intimacy-destroying defense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 749 (Number of characters: 497):
This can help
them to deconstruct their habits of instantly morphing abandonment feelings into rage and
disgust. As the recovering fight type becomes more conscious of his abandonment feelings, he can

learn to release his fear and shame with tears. I have helped several fight types by guiding them
to cry to release their hurt, rather than always polarizing to angering it out. When we are hurt,
part of us is sad and part of us is mad, and no amount of angering can ever metabolize our
sadness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 750 (Number of characters: 276):
Fight types need to see how their condescending, moral high-ground position alienates others
and perpetuates their present time abandonment. They must renounce the illusion of their own
perfection and the habit of projecting perfectionistic inner critic processes onto others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 751 (Number of characters: 76):
This is the
work of shrinking the Outer Critic as we will see in chapter 10.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 752 (Number of characters: 141):
Fight types also benefit from learning to take self-initiated timeouts whenever they notice
that they are triggered and feeling overcritical.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 753 (Number of characters: 203):
Timeouts can then be used to redirect the lion’s
share of their hurt feelings into grieving and working through their original abandonment, rather
than displacing it destructively onto current intimates.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 754 (Number of characters: 123):
Furthermore, like all 4F fixations, fight types need to become more flexible and adaptable
in using the other 4F responses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 755 (Number of characters: 118):
If you are a recovering fight type, it will especially benefit you
to learn the empathy response of the fawn position.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 756 (Number of characters: 82):
Begin by trying to imagine how it feels to be
the person you are interacting with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 757 (Number of characters: 25):
Do it as much as you can.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 758 (Number of characters: 152):
Moreover, you can expand on this
by developing mindfulness about the needs, rights and feelings of those with whom you would
like to have real intimacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 759 (Number of characters: 54):
In early recovery you can “fake it until you make it.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 760 (Number of characters: 161):
For without practicing consideration
for the other, and without reciprocity and dialogicality [as opposed to monologing], the intimacy
you crave will allude you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 761 (Number of characters: 135):
THE FLIGHT TYPE AND THE OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DEFENSE
Extreme flight types are like machines with the switch stuck in the “on” position.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 762 (Number of characters: 205):
They are
obsessively and compulsively driven by the unconscious belief that perfection will make them
safe and love-able. They rush to achieve. They rush as much in thought [obsession] as they do in
action

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 763 (Number of characters: 206):
[compulsion]. As children, flight types variably respond to their family trauma on a hyperactive
continuum. The flight defense continuum stretches between the extremes of the driven “A”
student and the ADHD

chunk 764 (Number of characters: 62):
[Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder] dropout running amok.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 765 (Number of characters: 235):
Flight
types relentlessly flee the inner pain of their abandonment with the symbolic flight of constant
busyness. Left-Brain Dissociation
When the obsessive/compulsive flight type is not doing, she is worrying and planning about
doing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 766 (Number of characters: 562):
She becomes what John Bradshaw calls a Human Doing [as opposed to a Human Being.] Obsessiveness is left-brain dissociation, as opposed to the classic right-brain dissociation of the
freeze type described below. Left-brain dissociation is using constant thinking to distract yourself from underlying

abandonment pain. When thinking is worrying, it is as if underlying fear wafts up and taints the
thinking process. Moreover, if compulsivity is hurrying to stay one step ahead of your repressed
pain, obsessing is worrying to stay one level above underlying pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 767 (Number of characters: 341):
As a flight type myself, I sometimes find myself obsessively worrying through my outline
just before a lecture. I do it, in part, to stay buoyant above my performance anxiety [a subset of
my abandonment fear]. In my early days of teaching I would also employ a compulsive defense
and pace as I anxiously searched my brain for a missing word.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 768 (Number of characters: 91):
Sometimes I would even scramble
frantically through the dictionary or thesaurus to find it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 769 (Number of characters: 357):
Unconsciously it was like I was
searching for a safe place beyond the gravity of my anxiety. Flight types are also prone to becoming addicted to their own adrenalin. Some recklessly
and regularly pursue risky and dangerous activities to jumpstart an adrenalin-high. Flight types
are also susceptible to the process addictions of workaholism and busy-holism.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 770 (Number of characters: 92):
To keep these
processes humming, they can deteriorate into stimulating substance addictions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 771 (Number of characters: 87):
Severely traumatized flight types may devolve into obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 772 (Number of characters: 237):
Recovering From A Polarized Flight Response
The flight types that I have worked with are so busy trying to stay one step ahead of their pain
that introspecting out loud in the therapy hour is the only time they find for self-examination.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 773 (Number of characters: 216):
Learning about the 4F model often helps them to renounce the perfectionistic demands of the
inner critic. I gently and repetitively focus on confronting their denial and minimization about the costs
of perfectionism.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 774 (Number of characters: 140):
This is especially important with workaholics who often admit their addiction
but secretly hold onto it as a badge of pride and superiority.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 775 (Number of characters: 68):
Flight types can get “stuck in their head” by being over-analytical.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 776 (Number of characters: 203):
Once a critical mass of
understanding Cptsd is achieved, it is crucial for them to start moving into their feelings. Sooner
or later, they must deepen their work by grieving about their childhood losses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 777 (Number of characters: 161):
Self-compassionate crying is an unparalleled tool for shrinking the obsessive perseverations
of the critic, and for ameliorating the habit of compulsive rushing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 778 (Number of characters: 204):
As her recovery progresses,
the flight type can acquire a “gearbox” that allows her to engage life at a variety of speeds,
including neutral. Neutral is especially important for flight types to cultivate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 779 (Number of characters: 158):
If you are a flight type, there are a plethora of self-help books, CD’s and classes that can
help you learn to relax and decrease the habit of habitual doing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 780 (Number of characters: 217):
This is so essential because you
can get so lost in busyness, that you have difficulty seeing the forest from the trees. This makes
you prone to prioritizing the wrong tasks and getting lost in inessential activities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 781 (Number of characters: 143):
When I am
triggered, I often feel pulled to busy myself with the simplest and easiest tasks, sometimes losing
sight of my key responsibilities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 782 (Number of characters: 140):
In flashback, flight types can deteriorate into chicken-with-its-head-cut-off mode, as fear
and anxiety propel them into scattered activity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 783 (Number of characters: 244):
Spinning their wheels, they can rush about
aimlessly, as if motion itself is the only thing important. At such times the flight type can rescue himself from panicky flight by inverting an old
cliché into: “Don’t just do something, stand there.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 784 (Number of characters: 162):
And, by stand there I mean stop and take
some time to become centered - and to re-prioritize. To accomplish this I recommend three
minute, mini-chair meditations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 785 (Number of characters: 295):
If you are a flight type, you can enhance your recovery greatly

by giving yourself a few of these each day. You can start a chair meditation by closing your eyes. Gently ask your body to relax. Feel each of your major muscle groups and softly encourage them
to relax. Breathe deeply and slowly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 786 (Number of characters: 185):
When you have relaxed your muscles and deepened and slowed your breathing, ask
yourself: “What is my most important priority right now? What is the most beneficial thing I can
do next?”

As you get more proficient at this and can manage sitting for a longer time, try the question:
“What hurt am I running from right now?

Finally, there are numerous flight types who exhibit symptoms that may be misdiagnosed as
Cyclothymia, a minor bipolar disorder.

This issue is addressed at length in chapter 12.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 791 (Number of characters: 550):
THE FREEZE TYPE AND THE DISSOCIATIVE DEFENSE The freeze response, also known as the camouflage response, often triggers a survivor into
hiding, isolating and avoiding human contact. The freeze type can be so frozen in the retreat
mode that it seems as if their starter button is stuck in the “off” position. Of all the 4F’s, freeze types seem to have the deepest unconscious belief that people and
danger are synonymous. While all 4F types commonly suffer from social anxiety as well, freeze
types typically take a great deal more refuge in solitude.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 792 (Number of characters: 89):
Some freeze types completely give up
on relating to others and become extremely isolated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 793 (Number of characters: 74):
Outside of fantasy, many also give up
entirely on the possibility of love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 794 (Number of characters: 24):
Right-Brain Dissociation

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 795 (Number of characters: 685):
It is often the scapegoat or the most profoundly abandoned child, “the lost child”, who is forced
to habituate to the freeze response. Not allowed to successfully employ fight, flight or fawn
responses, the freeze type’s defenses develop around classical or right-brain dissociation. Dissociation allows the freeze type to disconnect from experiencing his abandonment pain, and
protects him from risky social interactions - any of which might trigger feelings of being
retraumatized. If you are a freeze type, you may seek refuge and comfort by dissociating in prolonged
bouts of sleep, daydreaming, wishing and right-brain-dominant activities like TV, online
browsing and video games.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 796 (Number of characters: 72):
Freeze types sometimes have or appear to have Attention Deficit Disorder

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 797 (Number of characters: 6):
[ADD].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 798 (Number of characters: 226):
They
often master the art of changing the internal channel whenever inner experience becomes
uncomfortable. When they are especially traumatized or triggered, they may exhibit a schizoid-
like detachment from ordinary reality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 799 (Number of characters: 155):
And in worst case scenarios, they can decompensate into a
schizophrenic experience like the main character in the book, I Never Promised You a Rose
Garden.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 800 (Number of characters: 100):
Recovering From A Polarized Freeze Response
Recovery for freeze types involves three key challenges.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 801 (Number of characters: 229):
First, their positive relational experiences are few if any. They are therefore extremely
reluctant to enter into the type of intimate relationship that can be transformative. They are even
less likely to seek the aid of therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 802 (Number of characters: 96):
Moreover, those who manage to overcome this reluctance
often spook easily and quickly terminate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 803 (Number of characters: 61):
Second, freeze types have two commonalities with fight types.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 804 (Number of characters: 477):
They are less motivated to
try to understand the effects of their childhood traumatization. Many are unaware that they have
a troublesome inner critic or that they are in emotional pain. Furthermore, they tend to project the
perfectionistic demands of the critic onto others rather than onto themselves. This survival
mechanism helped them as children to use the imperfections of others as justification for
isolation. In the past, isolation was smart, safety-seeking behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 805 (Number of characters: 141):
Third, even more than workaholic flight types, freeze types are in denial about the life
narrowing consequences of their singular adaptation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 806 (Number of characters: 111):
Some freeze types that I have worked with
seem to have significant periods of contentment with their isolation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 807 (Number of characters: 173):
I think they may be able to
self-medicate by releasing the internal opioids that the animal brain is programmed to release
when danger is so great that death seems imminent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 808 (Number of characters: 511):
Internal opioid release is more accessible to freeze types because the freeze response has its
own continuum that culminates with the collapse response. The collapse response is an extreme
abandonment of consciousness. It appears to be an out-of-body experience that is the ultimate
dissociation. It can sometimes be seen in prey animals that are about to be killed. I have seen
nature films of small animals in the jaws of a predator that show it letting go so thoroughly that
its death appears to be painless.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 809 (Number of characters: 152):
However, the opioid production that some freeze types have access to, only takes the
survivor so far before its analgesic properties no longer function.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 810 (Number of characters: 59):
Numbed out contentment then
morphs into serious depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 811 (Number of characters: 515):
This in turn can lead to addictive self-medicating with
substances like alcohol, marijuana and narcotics. Alternatively, the freeze type can gravitate
toward ever escalating regimens of anti-depressants and anxiolytics. I also suspect that some
schizophrenics are extremely traumatized freeze types who dissociate so thoroughly that they
cannot find their way back to reality. Several of my freeze type respondents highly recommend a self-help book by Suzette Boon,
entitled Coping with Trauma-related Dissociation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 812 (Number of characters: 89):
This book is filled with very helpful work
sheets that are powerful tools for recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 813 (Number of characters: 376):
More than any other type, the freeze type usually requires a therapeutic relationship,
because their isolation prevents them from discovering relational healing through a friendship. That said, I know of some instances where good enough relational healing has come through pets
and the safer distant type of human healing that can be found in books and online internet
groups.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 814 (Number of characters: 96):
Phyllis, a self-proclaimed couch potato, began therapy with me with a great deal of ambivalence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 815 (Number of characters: 113):
Her third brand of anti-depressants no longer worked and her daily pot use was making her

increasingly paranoid.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 816 (Number of characters: 58):
Fantasies of dying were becoming more frequent and morbid.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 817 (Number of characters: 88):
She told
me: “I know therapy won’t help, but I’m afraid my husband is going to leave me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 818 (Number of characters: 35):
He says I’m
starting to scare him.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 819 (Number of characters: 145):
Phyllis managed being married because her husband paid the bills and left her alone with
her TV shows, science fiction books and online browsing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 820 (Number of characters: 90):
Additionally he was a workaholic,
rarely around and gone in the computer when he was home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 821 (Number of characters: 73):
In our therapy, trust building was a long gradual back and forth process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 822 (Number of characters: 71):
This is not un
common with many survivors, regardless of their 4F type.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 823 (Number of characters: 202):
Phyllis’s dark sense of humor was a saving grace, and helped her weather my
psychoeducation. She frequently met my attempts to link her current suffering and her awful
childhood with sarcastic rebuttal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 824 (Number of characters: 265):
Fortunately, growing up in New York gave me some resilience
to sarcasm. I was willing to weather her sardonic sense of humor because there was no mean
spiritedness in it. Eventually I was able to help her direct the angry part of her sarcasm at her bullying family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 825 (Number of characters: 76):
With that, my psychoeducation finally began to seep in with a ring of truth.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 826 (Number of characters: 458):
She gradually began
to angrily vent about her father’s sexual abuse, her mother’s silent collusion, and all of the family
using her for target practice. This in time morphed into crying which rewarded her with her first
ever experience of self-compassion. It was not until we reached this stage, some years into the therapy, that Phyllis got a
glimpse of the vicious inner critic that persecuted her. Prior to this she rebuffed my “critic
ravings” as absurd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 827 (Number of characters: 189):
When we progressed sufficiently with the inner critic, the same process
occurred with my hypotheses that she had a great deal of underlying fear and anxiety that was
keeping her housebound.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 828 (Number of characters: 69):
She laughed with a great deal of ironic amusement: “Look at me, Pete!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 829 (Number of characters: 18):
Nothing scares me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 830 (Number of characters: 64):
I am so relaxed that I can hardly hold my body up in this chair.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 831 (Number of characters: 5):
Jeez!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 832 (Number of characters: 32):
You
know I’m always nodding out.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 833 (Number of characters: 45):
My husband calls me ‘Mellow Yellow.’”[Phyllis

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 834 (Number of characters: 11):
is blonde].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 835 (Number of characters: 442):
A breakthrough eventually happened here when she passed a man on the sidewalk outside
my office that was a doppelganger for her father. She came into the session on the verge of
hyperventilating. As I helped her slow and deepen her breathing, she had a therapeutic flashback
in the office. She had a horrifying memory of her father sneaking into her bedroom at night. Much grieving then resolved this particular flashback to her sexual abuse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 836 (Number of characters: 54):
Phyllis’s denial shrunk significantly in this session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 837 (Number of characters: 70):
She really “got” that social anxiety was
imprisoning her on her couch.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 838 (Number of characters: 137):
Deep level recovery work then ensued from this point in time, and
culminated with Phyllis feeling emboldened enough to go back to school.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 839 (Number of characters: 127):
She went on to become
a medical assistant. This in turn opened the door to her finding a meaningful place in the outside
world.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 840 (Number of characters: 125):
A key part of the meaningfulness was the healthy friendship that she developed with a
fellow worker who was also in recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 841 (Number of characters: 66):
The progression of recovery for a freeze type is often as follows.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 842 (Number of characters: 256):
Gradual trust building
allows the recoveree to open to psychoeducation about the role of dreadful parenting in his
suffering. This then paves the way for the work of shrinking his critic, which in turn promotes
the work of grieving the losses of childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 843 (Number of characters: 103):
The anger work of grieving is especially therapeutic
for freeze types as is an aerobic exercise regime.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 844 (Number of characters: 60):
Both help resuscitate the survivor’s dormant
will and drive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 845 (Number of characters: 122):
THE FAWN TYPE AND THE CODEPENDENT DEFENSE

Fawn types seek safety by merging with the wishes, needs and demands of others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 846 (Number of characters: 149):
They act as if
they believe that the price of admission to any relationship is the forfeiture of all their needs,
rights, preferences and boundaries.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 847 (Number of characters: 60):
The disenfranchisement of the fawn type begins in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 848 (Number of characters: 515):
She learns early that a
modicum of safety and attachment can be gained by becoming the helpful and compliant servant
of her exploitive parents. A fawn type/codependent is usually the child of at least one narcissistic parent. The
narcissist reverses the parent-child relationship. The child is parentified and takes care of the
needs of the parent, who acts like a needy and sometimes tantruming child. When this occurs, the child may be turned into the parent’s confidant, substitute spouse,
coach, or housekeeper.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 849 (Number of characters: 67):
Or, she may be pressed into service to mother the younger siblings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 850 (Number of characters: 55):
In
worst case scenarios, she may be exploited sexually.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 851 (Number of characters: 57):
Some codependent children adapt by becoming entertaining.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 852 (Number of characters: 115):
Accordingly, the child learns
to be the court jester and is unofficially put in charge of keeping his parent happy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 853 (Number of characters: 557):
Pressing a child into codependent service usually involves scaring and shaming him out of
developing a sense of self. Of all the 4F types, fawn types are the most developmentally arrested
in their healthy sense of self. Recovering From A Polarized Fawn Response
Fawn types typically respond to psychoeducation about the 4F’s with great relief. This
eventually helps them to recognize the repetition compulsion that draws them to narcissistic
types who exploit them. The codependent needs to understand how she gives herself away by over-listening to
others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 854 (Number of characters: 144):
Recovery involves shrinking her characteristic listening defense, as well as practicing and
broadening her verbal and emotional self-expression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 855 (Number of characters: 190):
I have seen numerous inveterate codependents become motivated to work on their
assertiveness when they realize that even the thought of saying “no” triggers them into an
emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 856 (Number of characters: 142):
After a great deal of work, one client was shocked by how intensely he
dissociated when he contemplated confronting his boss’s awful behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 857 (Number of characters: 588):
This shock then
morphed into an epiphany of outrage about how dangerous it had been to protest anything in his
family. This in turn aided him greatly in overcoming his resistance to role-playing assertiveness
in our future work together. With considerable practice, this client learned to overcome the critic voices that
immediately short-circuited him from ever asserting himself. In the process, he remembered how
he was repeatedly forced to stifle his individuality in childhood. Grieving these losses then
helped him to work at reclaiming his developmentally arrested self-expression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 858 (Number of characters: 88):
Recovering from
the fawn position will be explored more extensively in the next chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 859 (Number of characters: 121):
TRAUMA HYBRIDS
There are, of course, few pure types. Moreover each type is on a continuum that runs from mild
to extreme.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 860 (Number of characters: 51):
Most trauma survivors are also hybrids of the 4F’s.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 861 (Number of characters: 93):
Most of us have a backup
response that we go to when our primary one is not effective enough.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 862 (Number of characters: 87):
When neither of these

work, we generally then have a third or fourth “go to” position.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 863 (Number of characters: 34):
Here are some common hybrid
types.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 864 (Number of characters: 274):
The Fight-Fawn Hybrid
The Fight-Fawn type corresponds with the charming bully described earlier. This type combines
two opposite polarities of relational style – narcissism and codependence. Narcissistic
entitlement, however, is typically at the core of the fight-fawn type.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 865 (Number of characters: 70):
This type, in the extreme,
can also be Borderline Personality Disorder

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 866 (Number of characters: 6):
[BPD].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 867 (Number of characters: 45):
She can frequently and dramatically vacillate

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 868 (Number of characters: 459):
[split] between a fight and fawn defense. When a fight-fawn type is upset with someone, she can
fluctuate over and over between attacking diatribes and fervent declarations of caring in a single
interaction. The fight-fawn is more deeply understood by contrasting him with the fawn-fight, described
in the next chapter. This fawn-fight type is also subject to vacillating during an emotional
flashback, but typically does so with less vitriol and entitlement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 869 (Number of characters: 111):
The fight-fawn also differs from the fawn-fight in that his “care-taking” often feels coercive
or manipulative.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 870 (Number of characters: 88):
It is frequently aimed at achieving personal agendas which range from blatant to
covert.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 871 (Number of characters: 346):
Moreover, the fight-fawn rarely takes any real responsibility for contributing to an
interpersonal problem. He typically ends up in the classic fight position of projecting
imperfection onto the other. This essentially narcissistic type is also different than the fawn-fight
in that entitlement is typically much more ascendant in the fight-fawn.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 872 (Number of characters: 68):
His fawn behavior is
typically devoid of real empathy or compassion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 873 (Number of characters: 96):
I have worked with several clients who were unfairly labeled borderline by themselves or others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 874 (Number of characters: 72):
I could however tell by the quality of their hearts, that they were not.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 875 (Number of characters: 269):
This was evidenced by their
essential kindness and goodwill to others, which they always return to when the flashback
resolves. They also exhibit this in their ability to feel and show true remorse when they hurt
another, as we are all destined to do from time to time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 876 (Number of characters: 407):
Unlike the true borderline who has a
narcissistic core, they can sincerely apologize and make amends when appropriate. Another variant of the fight/fawn is seen in the person who acts like a fight type in one
relationship while fawning in another. An example of this is the archetypal henpecked husband
who is a tyrant at work, and who also stays at work to all hours because he so prefers the fight
stance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 877 (Number of characters: 80):
This type also occurs in reverse: monster at home and lovely lady at the office.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 878 (Number of characters: 97):
The Flight-Freeze Hybrid
The Flight-Freeze type is the least relational and most schizoid hybrid.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 879 (Number of characters: 53):
He prefers the safety of
do-it-yourself isolationism.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 880 (Number of characters: 68):
Sometimes this type may also be misdiagnosed as Asperger’s
Syndrome.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 881 (Number of characters: 297):
The flight-freeze type avoids potential relationship-retraumati-zation with an obsessive-
compulsive/dissociative “two-step.” Step one is working to complete exhaustion. Step two is
collapsing into extreme “veging out”, and waiting until his energy reaccumulates enough to

relaunch into step one.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 882 (Number of characters: 87):
The price for this type of no-longer-necessary safety is a severely
narrowed existence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 883 (Number of characters: 118):
The flight-freeze cul-de-sac is more common among men, especially those traumatized for
being vulnerable in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 884 (Number of characters: 83):
This then drives them to seek safety in isolation or “intimacy-lite”
relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 885 (Number of characters: 117):
Some non-alpha type male survivors combine their flight and freeze defenses to become
stereotypical technology nerds.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 886 (Number of characters: 502):
Telecommuting is, of course, their preferred mode. Flight-freeze
types are the computer addicts who focus on work for long periods of time and then drift off
dissociatively into computer games, substance abuse or sleep-bingeing. Flight-freeze types are prone to becoming porn addicts. When in flight mode, they
obsessively surf the net for phantom partners and engage in compulsive masturbation. When in
freeze mode, they drift off into a right-brain sexual fantasy world if pornography is unavailable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 887 (Number of characters: 186):
Moreover, if they are in intimacy-lite relationship, they typically engage more with their
idealized fantasy partners than with their actual partner during real time sexual interactions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 888 (Number of characters: 81):
The Fight-Freeze Hybrid
These types rarely seek recovery on their own initiative.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 889 (Number of characters: 519):
A colleague of mine told me about a
fight-freeze type who was dragged into therapy by his wife. She complained that she was lucky
to get ten words out of him in a week. She was at the end of her rope and if therapy did not fix
him, she was filing for divorce. The husband was a computer engineer who telecommuted and only left his home office for
bathroom breaks and meals which were eaten separately from his wife. He bullied his wife into
providing these meals according to a written schedule that he e-mailed to her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 890 (Number of characters: 79):
My colleague’s initial “Hello” to the husband was met with a scowl and a grunt.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 891 (Number of characters: 149):
Intuitively,
she kept the focus off him as much as possible, but each delicate attempt to make connection
with him was rebuffed with sarcastic scorn.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 892 (Number of characters: 99):
“You expect me to fall for that phony smile?”;
“You’re not gonna shrink me with your psychobabble!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 893 (Number of characters: 175):
My colleague, who is the most compassionate, non-intrusive person I know, was not able to
crack the prickly fight shell that guarded this poor man’s extreme social withdrawal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 894 (Number of characters: 165):
No miracle
was performed, and my colleague said she was amazed in retrospect that he even lasted twenty
minutes before he left in a wake of hostility and resentment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 895 (Number of characters: 138):
I have met with fight-freeze types a few times in similar circumstances, i.e., they were
dragged into therapy under the threat of divorce.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 896 (Number of characters: 86):
Each was like the character in the famous poem:
“The Autocrat at the Breakfast Table.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 897 (Number of characters: 48):
The fight-freeze is a yin or passive narcissist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 898 (Number of characters: 97):
He demands that things go his way, but he is
not much interested in having any human interaction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 899 (Number of characters: 105):
No one gets to talk at the table, not even
him – unless of course someone needs to be put in their place.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 900 (Number of characters: 126):
The fight-freeze type is a John Wayne couch potato, dominating family life with foul
moods and monosyllabic grunts and curses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 901 (Number of characters: 303):
He is typically as untreatable as the extreme fight
types mentioned earlier.
SELF-ASSESSMENT I recommend that you self-assess your own hierarchical use of the 4F responses. Try to
determine your dominant type and hybrid, and think about what percentage of your time is spent
in each of the 4F responses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 902 (Number of characters: 131):
You can also assess where you lie on the relevant continuums that stretch between the two
extremes in each line of the chart below.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 903 (Number of characters: 205):
Continuums of Positive and Negative 4F Responses
Fight: Assertiveness 
 Bullying
Flight: Efficiency 
 Driven-ness
Freeze: Peacefulness 
 Catatonia
Fawn: Helpfulness 
 Servitude
Recovery And Self-Assessment

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 904 (Number of characters: 100):
As stated earlier, a key goal of recovery is to have easy and appropriate access to all of the 4F’s.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 905 (Number of characters: 323):
There are also two more continuums that can be used to assess this. The degree to which we are
balanced along each of them reflects the degree of our healing. The Fight 
 Fawn Continuum of Healthy Relating to Others
Healthy relating occurs when two people move easily and reciprocally between assertiveness and
receptivity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 906 (Number of characters: 176):
Common and important examples of this are an easy back and forth [1] between
talking and listening, [2] between helping and being helped, and [3] between leading and
following.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 907 (Number of characters: 363):
Normal healthy narcissism and codependence happen at the midpoint of the continuum. To
the degree that I polarize to the narcissistic/fight end of the continuum, I monologue and
dominate the conversation. To the degree that I polarize to the codependent/fawn end, I get stuck
in a listening defense, hiding from the vulnerability of showing what I think and feel.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 908 (Number of characters: 126):
Conversations, of course, will not always be exactly in the middle or it would be a Ping-
Pong-like exchange of monosyllables.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 909 (Number of characters: 39):
The real balance occurs more over time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 910 (Number of characters: 84):
For instance, in
an hour’s conversation, we each generally talk about half the time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 911 (Number of characters: 345):
The Flight 
 Freeze Continuum of Healthy Relating to Self
A healthy relationship with yourself is seen in your ability to move in a balanced way[1] between
doing and being, [2] between persistence and letting go, [3] between sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous system activation, and [4] between intense focus and relaxed,
daydreamy reverie.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 912 (Number of characters: 255):
RECOVERING FROM TRAUMA-BASED CODEPENDENCY
If you assessed yourself in the last chapter as a fawn subtype or as being on the right side of the
fight 
 fawn spectrum, you may find this chapter relevant even if the fawn response is not
your primary position.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 913 (Number of characters: 95):
Moreover the first section below contains important information about the
origins of all types.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 914 (Number of characters: 242):
I have dedicated a whole chapter to codependency because it is the 4F trauma response that
I know the most about. This knowledge comes from my own personal recovery journey, and
from specializing in treating codependency for over two decades.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 915 (Number of characters: 431):
I wrote the gist of this chapter one satori-blessed night when I noticed that I anxiously
apologized to a chair that I had bumped into. I think I probably apologized to inanimate objects
many times before in my life, but this was the first time I noticed it. Realizing that I had just apologized to a chair suddenly made me feel enraged. I felt furious
that something had happened to me to give me a Pavlovian “I’m sorry” response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 916 (Number of characters: 177):
I had been pursuing family of origin exploration for quite some time, and the accumulated
evidence quickly convinced me that my parents deeply imprinted me with a fawn response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 917 (Number of characters: 749):
I was
brainwashed with a default program to ingratiatingly apologize when anything in the natural
order of things changed around me. Sudden anxiety responses to apparently innocuous circumstances like my example are often
emotional flashbacks to earlier traumatic events. Sometimes a current event can have only the
vaguest resemblance to a past traumatic situation, and this can be enough to trigger the psyche’s
hard-wiring for a fight, flight, freeze or fawn response. In this case I fawned to the chair, subliminally experiencing it as a dangerous parent and
codependently apologizing to it like a toddler anticipating punishment for touching something

forbidden. As I free-associated on this I also realized that I was addicted to apologizing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 918 (Number of characters: 132):
I had
apologized for long traffic lights, for changes in the weather, and most especially for other
people’s mistakes and bad moods.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 919 (Number of characters: 226):
COMPARING FAWN ORIGINS WITH FIGHT, FLIGHT AND FREEZE
ORIGINS
I chose the name fawn for the fourth ‘F’ in the fight/flight/freeze/fawn typology, because
according to Webster, it means: “to act servilely; to cringe and flatter”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 920 (Number of characters: 201):
I believe it is this
response that is at the core of many codependents’ behavior. As a toddler, the codependent learns quickly that protesting abuse leads to even more
frightening parental retaliation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 921 (Number of characters: 155):
Thus she responds by relinquishing her fight response, deleting
“no” from her vocabulary and never developing the language skills of healthy assertiveness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 922 (Number of characters: 157):
Moreover, many abusive parents reserve their most harsh punishments for “talking back”,
and hence ruthlessly extinguish the fight response in their children.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 923 (Number of characters: 106):
Unfortunately, this typically
happens at such an early age that they later have little or no memory of it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 924 (Number of characters: 406):
The future codependent also learns early on that her natural flight response intensifies her
danger if she tries to flee. “I’ll teach you to run away from me!” is a common response that
precedes the spanking typically awarded to such behavior. Later, when the child is older she may also learn that the ultimate flight response, running
away from home, is hopelessly impractical and even more danger-laden.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 925 (Number of characters: 170):
Traumatizing families,
however, seem to be on the rise, as there is an epidemic of children [as young as pre-teens]
becoming runaways and ending up in dire circumstances.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 926 (Number of characters: 298):
Many toddlers, at some point, transmute the flight urge into the running around in circles of
hyperactivity. This adaptation “works” on some level to help them escape from the
uncontainable feelings of the abandonment mélange. Many of these unfortunates later
symbolically run away from their pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 927 (Number of characters: 470):
They deteriorate into the obsessive-compulsive
adaptations of workaholism, busyholism, spend-aholism, and sex and love addiction that are
common in flight types. The toddler who bypasses the adaptation of the flight defense may drift into developing the
freeze response and become the “lost child.” This child escapes his fear by slipping more and
more deeply into dissociation. He learns to let his parents’ verbal and emotional abuse “go in one
ear and out the other.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 928 (Number of characters: 142):
It is not uncommon for this type to devolve in adolescence into the
numbing substance addictions of pot, alcohol, opiates and other “downers”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 929 (Number of characters: 331):
The future codependent toddler, however, wisely gives up on the fight, flight and freeze
responses. Instead she learns to fawn her way into the occasional safety of being perceived as
helpful. It bears repeating that the fawn type is often one of the gifted children that Alice Miller
writes about in The Drama Of The Gifted Child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 930 (Number of characters: 125):
She is the precocious one who discovers that a
modicum of safety can be purchased by becoming variously useful to her parent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 931 (Number of characters: 81):
Servitude, ingratiation, and obsequiousness become important survival strategies.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 932 (Number of characters: 243):
She
cleverly forfeits all needs that might inconvenience her parents. She stops having preferences and
opinions that might anger them. Boundaries of every kind are surrendered to mollify her parents,
who repudiate their duty of caring for her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 933 (Number of characters: 115):
As we saw in the last chapter, she is often parentified
and becomes as thoroughly helpful to the parent as she can.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 934 (Number of characters: 84):
I wonder how many therapists besides me were prepared for their careers in this way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 935 (Number of characters: 463):
All this loss of self begins before the child has many words, and certainly no insight. For
the budding codependent, all hints of danger soon immediately trigger servile behaviors and
abdication of rights and needs. These response patterns are so deeply set in the psyche, that as adults, many codependents
automatically respond to threat like dogs, symbolically rolling over on their backs, wagging their
tails, hoping for a little mercy and an occasional scrap.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 936 (Number of characters: 115):
Webster’s second entry for fawn is: “to
show friendliness by licking hands, wagging its tail, etc.: said of a dog.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 937 (Number of characters: 543):
I find it tragic that some
codependents are as loyal as dogs to even the worst “masters”. Finally, I have noticed that extreme emotional abandonment, as described in chapter 5, also
creates this kind of codependency. The severely neglected child experiences extreme lack of
connection as traumatic, and sometimes responds to this fearful condition by overdeveloping the
fawn response. Once a child realizes that being useful and not requiring anything for herself gets
her some positive attention from her parents, codependency begins to grow.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 938 (Number of characters: 58):
It becomes an
increasingly automatic habit over the years.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 939 (Number of characters: 118):
A DEFINITON OF TRAUMA-BASED CODEPENDENCY
More than a few of my clients were initially put off by the term codependent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 940 (Number of characters: 110):
They found it
confusing or irrelevant because the descriptions they read or heard were presented derogatorily.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 941 (Number of characters: 77):
Moreover, some felt that the descriptions did not pertain to their condition.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 942 (Number of characters: 336):
If that is true for you,
the section below on codependent subtypes explains how the fawn response can manifest in a
variety of different behaviors. I define trauma-induced codependency as a syndrome of self-abandonment and self-
abnegation. Codependency is a fear-based inability to express rights, needs and boundaries in
relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 943 (Number of characters: 557):
It is a disorder of assertiveness, characterized by a dormant fight response and a
susceptibility to being exploited, abused and/or neglected. In conversations, codependents seek safety and acceptance in relationship through listening
and eliciting. They invite the other to talk rather than risk exposing their thoughts, views, and
feelings. They ask questions to keep the attention off themselves, because their parents taught
them that talking was dangerous and that their words were indictments that would inevitably
prove them guilty of being unworthy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 944 (Number of characters: 395):
The implicit code of the fawn type is that it is safer [1] to listen than to talk, [2] to agree
than to dissent, [3] to offer care than to ask for help, [4] to elicit the other than to express
yourself and [5] to leave choices to the other rather than to express preferences. Sadly, the closest
that the unrecovered fawn type comes to getting his needs met is vicariously through helping
others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 945 (Number of characters: 108):
Fawn types generally enhance their recovery by memorizing the list of Human Rights in
Toolbox 2, chapter 16.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 946 (Number of characters: 78):
I have this sardonic fantasy about two codependents going on their first date.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 947 (Number of characters: 249):
Somehow
they have agreed that they want to go to a movie, but how will they ever choose which one? “What do you want to see?” “Oh, I’m easy what do you want to see?” “It really doesn’t matter to
me, I like everything.” ‘Me too why don’t you choose?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 948 (Number of characters: 156):
“Oh I think it would be much better if
you pick.” “Oh I couldn’t, I never pick the right one.” “Me too, but I’m sure my pick would
definitely be the worst.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 949 (Number of characters: 632):
And so it goes, ad infinitum, until it is too late to see any show, and

relieved at not having to put themselves out there, they call it a night. CODEPENDENT SUBTYPES
I think a certain amount of the confusion about codependency can be clarified through
understanding the significant differences found in the three codependent subtypes that follow:
fawn-freeze, fawn-flight and fawn-fight. Fawn-Freeze: The Scapegoat
The fawn-freeze is typically the most codependently entrenched subtype. Not all scapegoats are
fawn-freeze, but since fawn and freeze types are both prone to extreme self-denial, many end up
in a scapegoat position.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 950 (Number of characters: 68):
This is also because these are the two most passive of the four F’s.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 951 (Number of characters: 346):
They have both typically
suffered the most punishment or rejection for asserting themselves in the toddler stage. When the fawn-freeze is not able to escape the scapegoat role in childhood, she is then set
up to be similarly victimized in adulthood. In worst case scenarios fawn-freezes are easily recognized by fight types who take them
captive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 952 (Number of characters: 81):
They may then turn them into doormats and subject them to domestic violence [DV].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 953 (Number of characters: 76):
Sometimes, the fawn-freeze does not even recognize that she is being abused.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 954 (Number of characters: 30):
Other times she
blames herself

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 955 (Number of characters: 29):
[as she had to in childhood].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 956 (Number of characters: 445):
Moreover, as we know from studying the DV cycle, many narcissistic abusers know when
and how to shower romantic tidbits on their victims just when they are at the point of leaving. These narcissists are often the charming bullies described in the last chapter. Their infrequent
tidbits have more warmth in them than anything the codependent received at home, so she
quickly becomes re-hooked, and just as quickly the cycle of abuse begins again.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 957 (Number of characters: 189):
It is important to note that many charming bullies also offer copious tidbits briefly in the
courtship stage, but these peter out to near starvation rations once the entrapment is complete.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 958 (Number of characters: 95):
Many fawn-freeze types only make token efforts at recovery, if they do not avoid it
altogether.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 959 (Number of characters: 156):
Often fawn-freezes were forced to so thoroughly abandon their protective instincts
that they become trapped in what psychologists call learned helplessness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 960 (Number of characters: 631):
Finally, there is growing evidence that a significant number of men also silently suffer
domestic violence. A male client once told me that no matter how much his wife assaulted him,
he couldn’t stop himself from saying “I’m sorry” to her. This only made her madder, but not as
mad as when he flashbacked into saying: “I’m sorry for saying ‘I’m sorry’ “, even though his
wife would slap him in the face every time he did. Not surprisingly, further investigation revealed a borderline mother who still slaps him in
the face when she is displeased with him. As a child he was required to keep his hands down
whenever she slapped him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 961 (Number of characters: 61):
He then had to apologize for making her “have to” punish him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 962 (Number of characters: 164):
Unfortunately, he left therapy after only a few sessions because his wife looked in his
checkbook, and then hit him repeatedly for “wasting his time and her money.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 963 (Number of characters: 105):
I have worked a great deal with these fawn-freeze types in my years of doing telephone
crisis counseling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 964 (Number of characters: 98):
Hope for them lies in understanding how their childhood abuse set them up for
their current abuse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 965 (Number of characters: 111):
This is often difficult, because scapegoated fawn-freezes were often punished

extra intensely for complaining.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 966 (Number of characters: 169):
Numerous times I have heard DV victims say: “But, I don’t want to act like a victim!” Usually, I then try to help them see how much they truly were victims in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 967 (Number of characters: 122):
However, if
I cannot get them to see this they usually are not able to rescue themselves from their current
victimization.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 968 (Number of characters: 224):
Fawn-Flight: Super Nurse
The fawn-flight type is most typically seen in the busyholic parent, nurse or administrative
assistant who works from dawn until bedtime providing for the needs of the household, hospital
or company.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 969 (Number of characters: 89):
He compulsively takes care of everyone else’s needs with hardly a gesture toward
his own.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 970 (Number of characters: 159):
The fawn-flight is sometimes a misguided Mother Teresa type, who escapes the pain of her
self-abandonment by seeing herself as the perfect, selfless caregiver.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 971 (Number of characters: 117):
She further distances
herself from her own pain by obsessive-compulsively rushing from one person in need to
another.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 972 (Number of characters: 60):
Some fawn-flight clients also become OCD-like clean-aholics.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 973 (Number of characters: 162):
One of my interns told me
that her fawn-flight client had a dozen color-coded tooth brushes for various micro-cleaning
tasks in her family’s bathroom and kitchen.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 974 (Number of characters: 56):
Some fawn-flights project their perfectionism on others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 975 (Number of characters: 90):
They can appoint themselves as
honorary advisers, and overburden others with their advice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 976 (Number of characters: 264):
However, it behooves fawn-flights to
learn that caring is not always about fixing. This is especially true when the person we are trying
to help is in emotional pain. Many times all that person needs is empathy, acceptance and an
opportunity to verbally ventilate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 977 (Number of characters: 52):
Moreover some mood states also need time to resolve.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 978 (Number of characters: 69):
Loving
people when they are feeling bad is a powerful kind of caring.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 979 (Number of characters: 58):
The above also relates to allowing others to be imperfect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 980 (Number of characters: 72):
We all have minor limitations and
foibles that may not be transformable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 981 (Number of characters: 75):
Loved ones need to be spared from being pressured to fix
what is unfixable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 982 (Number of characters: 80):
My way of approaching this is to always frame my advice as take-it or leave-
it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 983 (Number of characters: 72):
To prove this is so, I refrain from then going on about it repetitively.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 984 (Number of characters: 97):
Additionally, I typically
check in first to see if the other person actually wants some feedback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 985 (Number of characters: 323):
Fawn-Fight: Smother Mother
The recommendations in the last two paragraphs also apply to many of those survivors who are
fawn-fight types. Some can be quite aggressive in their attempts to help others. Typically they
equate helping with changing, and can alienate others by persistently pressuring them to take
their advice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 986 (Number of characters: 282):
The fawn-fight type is the smother-love caretaker. Her care-taking approach of being over-
focused on the other is sometimes a repetition of her childhood servant role. Moreover, her
helpfulness is usually less self-serving than the fight-fawn that we discussed in the last chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 987 (Number of characters: 129):
Nonetheless, the zealousness of her caretaking sometimes makes the recipient believe it when
she says “I just love you to death.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 988 (Number of characters: 92):
In flashback, the fawn-fight can deteriorate into manipulative or even coercive care-taking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 989 (Number of characters: 79):
He can smother love the other into conforming to his view of who she should be.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 990 (Number of characters: 443):
Fawn-fight types may periodically reach a critical mass of frustration that erupts when the
“patient” refuses his advice or balks at his unwanted caretaking. Sometimes the fawn-fight feels
an entitlement to punish the other “for their own good”, especially in a primary relationship. The fawn-fight is sometimes misdiagnosed as borderline personality disorder [BPD]. This is
because the fawn-fight can be emotionally intense during flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 991 (Number of characters: 167):
When triggered into a
panicky sense of abandonment, he feels desperate for love and can vacillate dramatically
between clawing for it or flatteringly groveling for it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 992 (Number of characters: 110):
He does not however have the core
narcissism of the true borderline that we looked at in the previous chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 993 (Number of characters: 299):
Another distinction between these two types is that fawn-fight type seeks real intimacy. She
is the most relational hybrid and most susceptible to love addiction. She stands in
contradistinction to the fight-fawn who is more addicted to physical release, and hence more
susceptible to sex addiction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 994 (Number of characters: 741):
MORE ON RECOVERING FROM A POLARIZED FAWN RESPONSE
Psychoeducation about their parents’ role in creating their fawn response has helped many of my
clients. Many instantly grasped that their codependence comes from having been continuously
attacked and shamed as selfish for even the most basic level of healthy self-interest. One fortyish client estimated that she had scorned herself as “selfish” countless times, until
one night she had the epiphany that she was by far not selfish enough. This occurred while she
was reading the comments of respondents to a website for adult children of narcissistic mothers [
www.narcissisticmothers.org ]. Suddenly she realized that her mother was the one with a
monopoly on self-interest in her family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 995 (Number of characters: 178):
My client then realized that every time she thought of
doing something for herself, she not only felt very anxious, but also ashamed that she was acting
as ghastly as her mother.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 996 (Number of characters: 138):
Fawns need to understand that fear of being attacked for lapses in ingratiation causes them
to forfeit their boundaries, rights and needs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 997 (Number of characters: 78):
Understanding this dynamic is a necessary but not
sufficient step in recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 998 (Number of characters: 186):
There are many codependents who realize their penchant for
forfeiting themselves, but who instantly forget everything they know when self-assertion is
appropriate in their relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 999 (Number of characters: 113):
In early recovery, I became increasingly aware in new dating situations of how much I was
over-eliciting my date.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1000 (Number of characters: 475):
Eventually, I was struck by how little I had to say for myself, but I found
it very difficult to break the pattern. Over time, I realized that my intention to be more forthcoming was frightening me into a
flashback. This made me dissociate and forget everything I had planned to say. All I could think
to do, when an amygdala hijacking took my left-brain off line, was to get my date talking. I then
regressed to the tried and true safety position of listening and eliciting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1001 (Number of characters: 424):
It wasn’t until my therapist recommended that I write down some key words on my palm
that I began to master the situation. Looking at the words brought my left-brain back online, and
I gradually got better at holding up my end of the getting-to-know-you conversation. Much later, I had the realization: “No wonder I wind up with one narcissist after another. Narcissists love me because I am so enabling of their monologing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1002 (Number of characters: 143):
I probably met lots of nice
balanced people who did not want another date with me because it seemed like I was hiding and
hard to get to know.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1003 (Number of characters: 72):
Around this time I also had a fawn type friend who had the same problem.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1004 (Number of characters: 428):
She liked to joke
that her listening and eliciting defenses where so perfected that she could turn anyone, even a
blank-screen therapist, into a monologing narcissist. To break free of their codependence, survivors must learn to stay present to the fear that
triggers the self-abdication of the fawn response. In the face of their fear, they must try on and
practice an expanding repertoire of more functional responses to fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1005 (Number of characters: 716):
[See the flashback
management steps in the next chapter]
Facing The Fear Of Self-Disclosure
Real motivation for surmounting this challenge usually comes from family of origin work. We
need to intuit and puzzle together a detailed picture of the trauma that first frightened us out of
our instincts of healthy self-expression. When we emotionally remember how overpowered we were as children, we can begin to
realize that it was because we were too small and powerless to assert ourselves. But now in our
adult bodies, we are in a much more powerful situation. And even though we might still momentarily feel small and helpless when we are triggered,
we can learn to remind ourselves that we are now in an adult body.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1006 (Number of characters: 140):
We have an adult status that
now offers us many more resources to champion ourselves and to effectively protest unfairness
in relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1007 (Number of characters: 589):
Grieving Through Codependence
I usually find that deconstructing codependence involves a considerable amount of grieving. Typically this entails many tears about the loss and pain of being so long without healthy self-
interest and self-protection. Grieving also unlocks healthy anger about a life lived with such a
diminished sense of self. This anger can then be used to build a healthy fight response. Once again, the fight response
is the basis of the instinct of self-protection, of balanced assertiveness, and of the courage that is
needed to make relationships equal and reciprocal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1008 (Number of characters: 600):
Later Stage Recovery
To facilitate the reclaiming of assertiveness, I encourage the survivor to imagine herself
confronting a current or past unfairness. This type of role-playing is often delicate work, as it can
invoke a therapeutic flashback that brings up old fear. As the survivor learns to stay present in assertiveness role-plays, she becomes more aware
of how fear triggers her into fawning. She can then practice staying present to her fear and acting
assertively anyway. With enough practice she then heals the developmental arrest of not having learned “to feel
the fear and do it anyway.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1009 (Number of characters: 444):
This in turn sets the stage for deconstructing self-harmful reactions to
fear like giving or compromising too much. Moreover, it makes the survivor more adept at
flashback management. As later stage recovery progresses, the survivor increasingly “knows her own mind”. She

slowly dissolves the habit of reflexively agreeing with other people’s preferences and opinions. She more easily expresses her own point of view and makes her own choices.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1010 (Number of characters: 56):
And most
importantly, she learns to stay inside herself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1011 (Number of characters: 297):
Many fawns survived by constantly focusing their awareness on their parents to figure out
what was needed to appease them. Some became almost psychic in their ability to read their
parents moods and expectations. This then helped them to figure out the best response to
neutralize parental danger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1012 (Number of characters: 54):
For some, it even occasionally won them some approval.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1013 (Number of characters: 166):
Survivors now need to deconstruct this habit by working to stay more inside their own
experience without constantly projecting their attention outward to read others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1014 (Number of characters: 107):
Fawn-types who
are still habituated to people-pleasing, must work on reducing their ingratiating behaviors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1015 (Number of characters: 143):
I have
noticed over the years that the degree to which a survivor strains to please me reflects the degree
to which his parents were dangerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1016 (Number of characters: 104):
Recovering requires us to become increasingly mindful of our automatic matching and
mirroring behaviors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1017 (Number of characters: 485):
This helps us decrease the habit of reflexively agreeing with everything that
anyone says. It is a great accomplishment to significantly reduce verbal matching. It is an even more
powerful achievement to reduce inauthentic emotional mirroring. Dysfunctional emotional matching is seen in behaviors such as acting amused at destructive
sarcasm, acting loving when someone is punishing, and acting forgiving when someone is
repetitively hurtful. I call this emotional individuation work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1018 (Number of characters: 258):
As such, recovery involves setting the kind of
boundaries that help us to stay true to our own actual emotional experience. In advanced recovery, this occurs when we reduce the habit of automatically shifting our
mood to match someone else’s emotional state.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1019 (Number of characters: 74):
By this, I do not mean suppressing empathic
attunement when it is genuine.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1020 (Number of characters: 75):
Crying and laughing along with an intimate is a truly wonderful
experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1021 (Number of characters: 121):
Rather, what I am recommending here is resisting the pressure to pretend you are always
feeling the same as someone else.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1022 (Number of characters: 195):
You do not have to laugh when something is not funny. When
a friend is feeling bad, you do not have to act like you feel bad. When you are feeling bad, you
do not have to act like you feel happy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1023 (Number of characters: 396):
Thankfully, I learned a great deal about this from being a therapist. When my client is
depressed, it does not help him if I adjust my mood and act depressed. Yet I am always genuinely empathic toward my client’s depression, because I can put
myself in his shoes via my own experiences of depression. I can be there caringly for him
without abandoning my own feeling of contentment in the moment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1024 (Number of characters: 176):
Similarly I can be feeling depressed while you are enthused about something and genuinely
appreciate your happiness without shamefully abandoning my temporarily depressed self.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1025 (Number of characters: 32):
Here is another example of this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1026 (Number of characters: 86):
You are in a great mood and tell me that you loved this old
musical that you just saw.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1027 (Number of characters: 53):
I, however, am feeling down and dislike old musicals.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1028 (Number of characters: 85):
If I were a fight
type, the table would be set for a great deal of mutual alienation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1029 (Number of characters: 191):
If I were an unrecovered fawn type, however, I might strangle my bad mood and my
musical taste, and anxiously squeeze out a high-pitched, forced frivolity about how wonderful
Fred Astaire is.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1030 (Number of characters: 55):
Instead, I can reach for a deeper more authentic truth.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1031 (Number of characters: 62):
I can let you know that I
am pleased you had such a nice time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1032 (Number of characters: 69):
After all, I really believe in different strokes for different
folks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1033 (Number of characters: 69):
As I write this, I flash on Bruno, a dear old hospice client of mine.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1034 (Number of characters: 83):
During a visit, with him,
he told me: “I can’t stand talking to that new volunteer.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1035 (Number of characters: 42):
She acts so morose whenever she visits
me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1036 (Number of characters: 45):
I mean, who the hell’s dying here… me or her?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1037 (Number of characters: 136):
I tell ya I don’t know who is worse – her or
that other smiley volunteer, the one who always acts like she just walked into Disneyland.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1038 (Number of characters: 122):
“Disapproval Is Okay With Me”
Early in recovery, an esteemed mentor gave me the affirmation “Disapproval is okay with me.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1039 (Number of characters: 98):
Codependently, I enthusiastically welcomed his advice that I should practice it until it was true.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1040 (Number of characters: 38):
Privately I thought “Surely you jest!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1041 (Number of characters: 121):
I had survived the previous thirty years with a Will
Rogers-like mission to prove that “I never met a man I didn’t like.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1042 (Number of characters: 209):
I did not yet know that I had unconsciously gravitated to this all-or-none nonsense because I
was somewhat desperately trying to seduce everyone I met into liking me in the hope that I could
finally feel safe.

As I thought further about this affirmation, I judged it as patently absurd and eminently
unachievable.

Yet within a week something ignited in me that really wanted it to become true.

--------------------------------------------------

Since it was still a long time before I knew anything about code-pendence, it took almost
two decades to make any progress at all.

The importance of learning to handle and accept
disapproval faded in and out of my awareness myriad times.

--------------------------------------------------

But now as I write thirty years later, I feel it is one of the most important things I have ever
learned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1048 (Number of characters: 152):
I rest most of the time in receiving so much approval from my friends and intimates that
I can usually let in their constructive feedback fairly easily.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1049 (Number of characters: 105):
As a corollary to this, I rarely care
what people think about me who I do not know or who do not know me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1050 (Number of characters: 53):
And, of course, this is not a perfect accomplishment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1051 (Number of characters: 234):
Disapproval can still on occasion
trigger me into a flashback. But it delights me to report that I now experience most disapproval
with considerable equanimity. I even occasionally experience some people’s disapproval as a
good thing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1052 (Number of characters: 349):
Sometimes it is a validation that I am doing the right thing and evolving in the right
direction. Nowhere is this truer than with the disapproval of the narcissistic parents or partners of
clients whom I am working to rescue from their enslavement. Their disapproval of me is actually
an affirmation that I have indeed been involved in right action.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1053 (Number of characters: 428):
Most of the time, disapproval is okay with me. MANAGING EMOTIONAL FLASHBACKS
Emotional flashbacks are intensely disturbing regressions [“amygdala hijackings”] to the
overwhelming feeling-states of your childhood abandonment. When you are stuck in a flashback,
fear, shame and/or depression can dominate your experience. These are some common experiences of being in an emotional flashback. You feel little,
fragile and helpless.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1054 (Number of characters: 45):
Everything feels too hard. Life is too scary.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1055 (Number of characters: 43):
Being seen feels excruciatingly
vulnerable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1056 (Number of characters: 30):
Your battery seems to be dead.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1057 (Number of characters: 623):
In the worst flashbacks an apocalypse feels like it will
imminently be upon you. When you are trapped in a flashback, you are reliving the worst emotional times of you
childhood. Everything feels overwhelming and confusing, especially because there are rarely any
visual components to a Cptsd flashback. This is because, as Goleman’s work shows, amygdala
hijackings are intense reactions in the emotional memory part of the brain that override the
rational brain. These reactions occur in the brains of people who have been triggered into a 4F
reaction so often, that minor events can now trigger them into a panicky state.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1058 (Number of characters: 460):
This is a list of 13 practical steps for helping yourself to manage an emotional flashback:
13 Steps for Managing Emotional Flashbacks [Focus on Bold Print when flashback is active]
1. Say to yourself: “I am having a flashback”. Flashbacks take you into a timeless part
of the psyche that feels as helpless, hopeless and surrounded by danger as you were in
childhood. The feelings and sensations you are experiencing are past memories that
cannot hurt you now.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1059 (Number of characters: 179):
2. Remind yourself: “I feel afraid but I am not in danger! I am safe now, here in the
present.” Remember you are now in the safety of the present, far from the danger of
the past.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1060 (Number of characters: 42):
3. Own your right/need to have boundaries.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1061 (Number of characters: 141):
Remind yourself that you do not have to
allow anyone to mistreat you; you are free to leave dangerous situations and protest
unfair behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1062 (Number of characters: 41):
4. Speak reassuringly to the Inner Child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1063 (Number of characters: 148):
The child needs to know that you love
her/him unconditionally– that s/he can come to you for comfort and protection when
s/he feels lost and scared.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1100 (Number of characters: 126):
Triggers And Emotional Flashbacks
A trigger is an external or internal stimulus that activates us into an emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1101 (Number of characters: 787):
This
often occurs on a subliminal level outside the boundaries of normal consciousness. Recognizing
what triggers us can therefore be difficult. Nonetheless, becoming increasingly mindful of our
triggers is crucial because it sometimes allows us to avoid flashback-inducing people, situations
and behaviors. External triggers are people, places, things, events, facial expressions, styles of
communication, etc., that remind us of our original trauma in a way that flashes us back into the
painful feelings of those times. Here are some examples of powerful and common triggers:
revisiting your parents; seeing someone who resembles a childhood abuser; experiencing the
anniversary of an especially traumatic event; hearing someone use a parent’s shaming tone of
voice or turn of phrase.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1102 (Number of characters: 42):
Many triggers however are not so explicit.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1103 (Number of characters: 263):
Sometimes all unknown adults can trigger us
into fear even when there is no resemblance to our original abuser[s]. I still occasionally feel
triggered when I come across a group of teenagers, because I grew up in a neighborhood where
there were many violent ones.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1104 (Number of characters: 104):
For this reason, my son who is quite empathic joked that he will
not become a teenager when he grows up.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1105 (Number of characters: 385):
Sometimes someone looking at us, or even noticing us, can trigger us into fear and toxic
shame. One of my clients once came in intensely triggered because a cat was staring at him. Other common triggers include making a mistake, asking for help, or having to speak in front of
a group of people. Moreover, simply feeling tired, sick, lonely or hungry can sometimes trigger a
flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1106 (Number of characters: 48):
Any type of physical pain can also be a trigger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1107 (Number of characters: 64):
For many survivors, authority figures are the ultimate triggers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1108 (Number of characters: 237):
I have known several
survivors, who have never gotten so much as a parking ticket, who cringe in anxiety whenever
they come across a policeman or a police car. It took me decades to overcome my intense performance anxiety about teaching.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1109 (Number of characters: 67):
Nothing
could trigger me more than an upcoming teaching engagement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1110 (Number of characters: 423):
Fortunately I was unwilling to
give up this activity, because I enjoyed it most of the time once I got going. I did not make any
real progress, beyond learning to “white-knuckle it,” until I recognized my performance anxiety

as a flashback to the danger of talking at family dinner time. This recognition allowed me to see
that I was unconsciously terrified that my parents were going to show up and scoff at me in
public.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1111 (Number of characters: 425):
At first, I [my critic] labeled this a preposterous idea, but when I started to imagine and
practice aggressively defending myself against them on the drive to my teaching engagement, I
soon experienced an enormous reduction in my anxiety. This experience lead to me formulating
Step 6 in the flashback management steps above, as well as my ideas about angering against the
critic, which will be explored in the next chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1112 (Number of characters: 203):
The Look: A Common Trigger Of Emotional Flashbacks
Early on in working with this model, I was surprised that certain clients with relatively moderate
childhood abuse were plagued by emotional flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1113 (Number of characters: 71):
Most of them in fact were quite sure that
they had never even been hit.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1114 (Number of characters: 288):
Many of them however would talk about how they hated it when
their parents gave them the look. The look, in most cases, is the facial expression that typically accompanies contempt. Contempt is a powerful punishing visage backed up by an emotional force-field of intimidation
and disgust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1115 (Number of characters: 75):
A raised voice can be added intermittently to the look to amp up its power.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1116 (Number of characters: 751):
When a parent gives the look to a child, she is “telling” him that he is not only in serious
jeopardy, but that he is also “a sorry excuse for a human being”. Over time, the look can make
the recipient feel terrified and repugnant, as it drives him into an emotional flashback of fear and
shame. When the look is used to control an older child, it commonly flashes her back to an earlier,
pre-memory time when the look was empowered by traumatizing punishment. The look rarely
terrifies a child into obedience unless it has previously been paired with hitting or other dire
consequences. Years of working at Parental Stress Services convinced me that most young
children ignore the look unless it was previously accompanied by traumatizing punishment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1117 (Number of characters: 81):
Typically, the look is empowered via a psychological process called conditioning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1118 (Number of characters: 51):
Here is a
classic example of aversive conditioning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1119 (Number of characters: 323):
Technicians deliver an electric shock to an animal in a
cage at the same time that they ring a bell. The animal of course has a fearful and distressed
response to the shock. It does not, however, take many repetitions of pairing the sound with the
shock before the sound alone elicits the same upset response in the animal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1120 (Number of characters: 652):
This is analogous, I believe, to how a child learns to be terrified of the look. With enough
pairings of the look with physical punishment or extreme abandonment, the parent can
eventually delete the smack and get the same results with just the look. With enough repetitions
in early childhood, this pairing can last a lifetime, so that the parent can control the child forever
with the look. In my hospice work, I have seen several dying, ninety-pound mothers still able to
put the fear of god into their huge sons with the look. The look then is a powerful trigger for making adult survivors flashback to the fear and
humiliation of their childhoods.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1121 (Number of characters: 196):
Once again, many of my clients do not remember this because
the punishment only had to accompany the look for a few months while they were toddlers
before it became permanently wired as a trigger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1122 (Number of characters: 88):
Moreover, it is the rare person who has any
memory before he is three or four years old.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1123 (Number of characters: 71):
Unfortunately the look can continue to work even after the parent dies.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1124 (Number of characters: 41):
There are at least

two reasons for this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1125 (Number of characters: 152):
First, we internalize our parents in a way that they can subliminally appear in our
imaginations and give us the look whenever we are less than perfect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1126 (Number of characters: 60):
This includes
“imperfections” in thought, feeling or action.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1127 (Number of characters: 131):
Sadly, I often see this subliminal look mimicked on the faces of my flashbacked clients as
they scowl contemptuously at themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1128 (Number of characters: 117):
And second, when anyone else looks at us disapprovingly, we can generalize that they are
as dangerous as our parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1129 (Number of characters: 264):
This is what happened to me in the emotional flashback that I
described in chapter 1. The worst thing about having been traumatized with the look in childhood is that we can
erroneously transfer and project our memory of it onto other people when we are triggered.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1130 (Number of characters: 139):
We
are especially prone to doing this with authority figures or people that resemble our parents, even
when they are not sporting the look.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1131 (Number of characters: 306):
Internal vs. External Triggers
As we move out of early recovery, we begin to observe that internal triggers are even more
common than external ones. Such triggers are commonly the nasty spawn of the inner critic. Typically they are thoughts and visualizations about endangerment or the need for perfection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1132 (Number of characters: 335):
The survivor may, seemingly without reason, visualize someone being abusive. Moreover he can
also, seemingly out of the blue, worry himself into a flashback by simply thinking he is not
perfectly executing a task that he is undertaking. He can also frighten himself by enumerating the
many ways that he might mess up any upcoming task.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1133 (Number of characters: 247):
When internal triggering is at its worst, small potato miscues and peccadilloes trigger us
into a full blown emotional flashback. We then devolve into a polarized process of negative-
noticing – an incessant preoccupation with defects and hazards.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1134 (Number of characters: 590):
We perseverate about everything
that has gone or could go wrong. As recovery progresses, many survivors are shocked to discover that the majority of their
flashbacks are triggered internally by these types of inner critic programs. We will explore below
and in the next two chapters the ways we can rescue ourselves from the critic’s internal
triggering processes. Progressive Trigger-Recognition
With ongoing recovery, we become more knowledgeable about our triggers, and avoid them
when practical. Identifying our triggers also helps us to get into flashback management mode
more quickly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1135 (Number of characters: 72):
Recognition further aids us to handle unavoidable triggering situations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1136 (Number of characters: 161):
Forethought allows
us to prophylactically practice flashback management before we get activated, as I did in the
performance anxiety situation mentioned earlier.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1137 (Number of characters: 604):
Recognizing the moment of triggering is even more important than recognizing the trigger
itself. This is because flashbacks sometimes start out subtly and then progressively become more
intense. Early recognition therefore helps us to invoke the steps earlier, and decrease the intensity
and duration of the flashback. Finally, resolving a flashback requires rebalancing significant biochemical changes in the
brain and body that take time to subside. For example, over-adrenalization sometimes
dramatically morphs into the hangover of adrenalin exhaustion, before the adrenal function can
be rebalanced.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1138 (Number of characters: 478):
Decreasing the intensity of a flashback with quick remedial action decreases the
time it takes for our physiology to recover. Signs Of Being In A Flashback
We can often find ourselves in a flashback without ever having seen the “flash.” There are a
variety of clues that we can learn to identify as signs that we are caught in a flashback. This is
essential to recovery, as naming our experience “flashback” [step#1 in flashback management]
often immediately brings some relief.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1139 (Number of characters: 107):
Even more importantly, it points us in the direction of
working the other 12 steps of flashback management.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1140 (Number of characters: 84):
One common sign of being flashed-back is that we feel small, helpless, and hopeless.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1141 (Number of characters: 115):
In
intense flashbacks this magnifies into feeling so ashamed that we are loath to go out or show our
face anywhere.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1142 (Number of characters: 82):
Feeling fragile, on edge, delicate and easily crushable is another aspect of this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1143 (Number of characters: 101):
The survivor may also notice an evaporation of whatever self-esteem he has earned since he left
home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1144 (Number of characters: 103):
This is a flashback to the childhood years where implicit family rules forbade any self-
esteem at all.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1145 (Number of characters: 656):
Another common clue that we are flashing back is an increase in the virulence of the inner
or outer critic. This typically looks like increased drasticizing and catastrophizing, as well as
intensified self-criticism or judgmentalness of others. A very common example of this is lapsing
into extremely polarized, all-or-none thinking such as only being able to see what is wrong with
yourself and/or others. In my own mid-level recovery, I learned that when I was feeling especially judgmental of
others, it usually meant that I had flashed back to being around my critical parents. The trigger
was usually that some vulnerability of mine was in ascendancy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1146 (Number of characters: 159):
In response, I then over-noticed
others’ faults so that I could justify avoiding them and the embarrassment of being seen in a state
of not being shiny enough.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1147 (Number of characters: 140):
Another clue that we are in a flashback occurs when we notice that our emotional reactions
are out of proportion to what has triggered them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1148 (Number of characters: 38):
Here are two common instances of this:

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1149 (Number of characters: 99):
[1] a
minor upset feels like an emergency; [2] a minor unfairness feels like a travesty of justice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1150 (Number of characters: 132):
In the first instance, you drop a book that you are carrying and launch into an angry, self-
berating tirade that lingers for hours.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1151 (Number of characters: 167):
In the second instance, another driver’s relatively harmless,
un-signaled lane change triggers you into rageful indignation that reverberates in your psyche for
hours.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1152 (Number of characters: 460):
When we are not mindful at such times, we can erupt against ourselves in self-disgust and
self-hatred, or we can unfairly explode out against the relatively innocent other. On the other hand, we can choose healthy flashback management once we recognize these
examples as flashbacks to the real emergencies and injustices of our childhood. Furthermore, we
can harvest recovery out of these unpleasant flashbacks by seeing them as proof that we were
traumatized.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1153 (Number of characters: 130):
When we do the latter, we can morph our anger into healthy indignation about the
outrageously unfair conditions of our upbringing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1154 (Number of characters: 122):
More On Self-Medication
Another clue about being in a flashback is an increased use of primitive self-soothing techniques.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1155 (Number of characters: 547):
Many survivors learn early in life to manage their painful feelings with food, distracting
activities or mood-altering substances. Over time self-medication can become habitual and
devolve into substance or process addictions. With self-medication, I believe there is a continuum of severity that stretches from
occasional use on one end to true addiction on the other. For many survivors, self-medication is a
matter of degree. An especially strong urge to use more substance or process than normal is a
powerful clue that you are in a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1156 (Number of characters: 134):
With practice, mindfully noticing a sudden upsurge in
craving can be interpreted as the need to invoke the flashback management steps.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1157 (Number of characters: 500):
Moreover, I
see many survivors gradually decrease their self-medicating habits by effectively using these
steps. Flashbacks In Therapy Sessions This section is for survivors who are in therapy or contemplating starting it. Over the years, I
have noticed that as survivors feel safe enough with me, opportunities arise more frequently for
working with flashbacks during sessions. Sometimes it even seems that some part of them
“schedules” their flashbacks to occur just prior to or during our session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1158 (Number of characters: 79):
It is as if they are
looking for “on the job training” in flashback management.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1159 (Number of characters: 87):
Some therapists describe this as
regression in the service of building the healthy ego.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1160 (Number of characters: 115):
I recently experienced this with a client who rushed into my office five minutes late, visibly
flushed and anxious.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1161 (Number of characters: 56):
She opened the session by exclaiming: “I’m such a loser.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1162 (Number of characters: 26):
I can’t do
anything right.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1163 (Number of characters: 37):
You must be sick of working with me.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1164 (Number of characters: 120):
This was someone who had, on previous
occasions, been moved by my validation of her ongoing accomplishments in our work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1165 (Number of characters: 709):
Based on what she had uncovered about her mother’s punitive perfectionism in previous
sessions, I was certain that being late had triggered her into an emotional flashback. In this
moment, she was experiencing right-brain emotional dominance and a decrease in left-brain
rational thinking. As so often happens in a flashback, she temporarily lost access to her post-
childhood knowledge and understanding. This appears to be a mechanism of dissociation, and in
this instance, it rendered my client amnesiac of my high regard for our work together. I believe this type of dissociation also accounts for the recurring disappearance of
previously established trust that commonly occurs with emotional flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1166 (Number of characters: 486):
As we progress in
our recovery, we learn that flashbacks can cause us to forget that our proven allies are in fact still
reliable. With enough practice, however, we can learn to interpret feelings of distrust with proven
friends as evidence that we are in a flashback. We are flashing back to our childhoods when no
one was trustworthy. Grieving Resolves Flashback [Step # 9]
Returning to the above vignette, I wondered out loud to my client, “Do you think you might be in
a flashback?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1167 (Number of characters: 396):
Because of the numerous times we had previously identified her emotional upsets
as flashbacks, she immediately recognized this and let go into deep sobbing. She dropped into

profound grieving. Her crying combined tears of relief with tears of grief. Her tears of relief came from being
able to take in my empathy. Her tears of grief were the feelings of her abject childhood pain
being released.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1168 (Number of characters: 479):
Her tears of relief also came from once again remembering the source of this
previously confusing and overwhelming pain. My client continued to cry and released more of the pain of her original trauma. Further
tears were about being stuck so often in flashbacks. As her tears subsided, she recalled a time as
a small child when she literally received a single lump of coal in her Christmas stocking. Mean
mom had “scrooged” her as punishment for being ten minutes late to dinner.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1169 (Number of characters: 204):
Her tears then
morphed into healthy anger about this abuse, and she felt herself returning to an empowered
sense of self. Grieving brought her back into the present and broke the amnesia of the flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1170 (Number of characters: 62):
She then remembered to invoke her instinct of self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1171 (Number of characters: 79):
We had gradually been
rebuilding it with role-plays and assertiveness training.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1172 (Number of characters: 232):
She angrily vented about her parents’
destruction of her right to defend herself against abuse and unfairness. She started cheekily
chanting “That’s not fair!” as if to show her parents they could no longer attack her for saying it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1173 (Number of characters: 235):
She then moved further into reiterating her right to have boundaries. She mocked mom and
dad as poor excuses for parents. And then she turned her anger onto the critic with a resounding
refrain of saying “no”. “No, you cannot judge me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1174 (Number of characters: 37):
No, you cannot pick me apart anymore.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1175 (Number of characters: 58):
No
you cannot waste my time with all your stupid worries!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1176 (Number of characters: 391):
Finally, I reminded her to reinvoke her sense of safety by recognizing that she now
inhabited an adult body. She was now free of parental control. She had many resources to draw
on: intelligence, strength, resilience, and a growing sense of community. She lived in a safe
home. She had the support of her therapist and two friends who were her allies and who readily
saw her essential worth.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1177 (Number of characters: 530):
I also observed that she was making ongoing progress in managing her flashbacks which
were occurring less often and less intensely. After about forty minutes, she was released from the flashback. I have witnessed this
restorative power of grieving on innumerable occasions. The intricacies of therapeutic grieving
will be explored in chapter 11. Managing The Inner Critic [Step # 8]
When Cptsd survivors come of age and launch from the traumatizing family, they are often
unaware that their minds are dominated by an inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1178 (Number of characters: 170):
In assisting others to manage
flashbacks, the most common help I offer is to encourage them to challenge the alarmist and
perfectionistic programming of the inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1179 (Number of characters: 55):
This type of scenario arises frequently in my practice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1180 (Number of characters: 110):
A client, in the midst of reporting an
inconsequential mistake, suddenly launches into a catastrophizing tale.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1181 (Number of characters: 117):
He reports from his
critic’s nightmarish fantasy that his life is deteriorating into a cascading series of disasters.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1182 (Number of characters: 78):
He is
flashing back to the way he was continuously over-punished in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1183 (Number of characters: 131):
One of my client’s drasticizing sounded like this: “My boss looked at me funny when I
came back from my bathroom break this morning

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1184 (Number of characters: 65):
and I know he thinks I’m stupid and lazy and
is going to fire me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1185 (Number of characters: 47):
I just know I won’t be able to get another job.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1186 (Number of characters: 50):
My girlfriend will think I’m a
loser and leave me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1187 (Number of characters: 132):
I’ll get sick from the stress, and with no money to pay my medical insurance

and rent, I’ll soon be living out of a shopping cart.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1188 (Number of characters: 99):
It’s disturbing how many drasticizing inner
critic rants end with up with an image of homelessness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1189 (Number of characters: 29):
What a symbol of abandonment!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1190 (Number of characters: 437):
Recovering requires being able to recognize inner-critic catastrophizing so that we can
resist it with thought-stopping and thought-correction. In this case, I reminded my client of the
many times we had caught his critic “freaking out” about every conceivable way his life could go
down the tubes. I then encouraged him to refuse to indulge this process, and to angrily say “no”
to the critic every time it tried to scare or demean him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1191 (Number of characters: 85):
Finally, I reminded him of all the positive experiences he actually had with his boss

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1192 (Number of characters: 21):
[thought-correction].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1193 (Number of characters: 572):
I also helped him enumerate his many successes at work, at school and at
life in general. The inner critic not only exacerbates flashbacks, but eventually grows into a psychic agency
that triggers them. Reversing the damaging effects of the critic is the subject of the next two
chapters
ADVANCED FLASHBACK MANAGEMENT
Waking Up In The Abandonment Depression
As recovery progresses, you notice more subtlety in the triggering process. As you do, you
become more mindful of your inner critic’s hard-to-detect triggers. You also discover that some
triggers are indiscernible.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1194 (Number of characters: 499):
This is especially true of triggering that occurs during sleep. Advanced flashback management, then, involves learning how to manage the disconcerting
experience of falling asleep feeling reasonably put together and waking up in a flashback. Typically this occurs because a dream has triggered you into a flashback. If you remember the
dream, you can sometimes figure out why it triggered you. With growing mindfulness you may
even understand which events from the previous day triggered your dream.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1195 (Number of characters: 77):
The most difficult situation to manage is when you cannot remember the dream.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1196 (Number of characters: 69):
This type
of flashback can feel particularly unfair and discouraging.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1197 (Number of characters: 519):
It is rich fodder for the critic, which
can declare that you are not only getting nowhere in his recovery, you are getting worse. Flashbacks As The Inner Child’s Plea For Help
With undetectable triggers, I find that it is most helpful to see a flashback as a communication
from the child that you were. The child is reminding you that he woke up feeling desolate
innumerable times in that house that was not a home. He woke up daunted by the prospect of
once again having to reenter the poisonous milieu of your family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1198 (Number of characters: 124):
The child is now asking you to
meet his unmet need of having someone to go to for comfort when he wakes up feeling
wretched.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1199 (Number of characters: 31):
It is as if he is saying: “See!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1200 (Number of characters: 469):
This is how bad it was – this is how overwhelmed,
ashamed and miserable I felt so much of the time.”
Managing the pain of waking up in the abandonment depression is one of the most difficult,
long term challenges in recovery. Sleep seems to be a regressive, right-brain dominant
experience. It is not uncommon to wake up with a temporary loss of access to the left-brain
cognitive functions that control our more sophisticated understandings of our present-day reality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1201 (Number of characters: 111):
Without the latter, flashback management often reverts to the critic and our early childhood

attempts to cope.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1202 (Number of characters: 134):
This creates a fruitful ground for the critic to explode its arsenal of self-
pathologizing programs [enumerated in the next chapter].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1203 (Number of characters: 145):
Years ago, I customarily responded to awakening in flashback with hypochondriasizing
ruminations about my health: “What’s happening to my energy?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1204 (Number of characters: 42):
Something must be seriously
wrong with me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1205 (Number of characters: 30):
I feel like death warmed over.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1206 (Number of characters: 41):
That ache in my back is probably a tumor.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1207 (Number of characters: 29):
I lost
two pounds this month.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1208 (Number of characters: 23):
I just know its cancer!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1209 (Number of characters: 46):
I wish I could just die and get it over with.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1210 (Number of characters: 387):
This kind of drasticizing could and did sometimes go on for hours – even days. Moreover, it
typically pulled me out of the abandonment depression by creating so much anxiety, that I was
forced out of bed into busyholic rushing. I would then hurry through the day unconsciously
rushing to outdistance myself from this awful thinking process, as well as the abandonment pain
underlying it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1211 (Number of characters: 610):
Because of a great deal of practice, I now quickly realize that hypochondriasizing means
that I am in a flashback. Accordingly, I work to shift the focus of my thought processes to the
theme of generating love and kindness to the child within me. I dedicate this work to my
historical child who woke up countless times feeling horribly abandoned in my love-
impoverished family of origin. For me, this is now my most practiced flashback management
process: breaking my merge with the critic to concentrate on caring for myself. There is another type of flashback message that seems to come from my inner child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1212 (Number of characters: 150):
It is that I
have slipped back into my old habit of neglecting him. Often it occurs when I ignore him by
regressing into overusing my flight response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1213 (Number of characters: 115):
My flashback then seems to be his clamoring for
some proof that my compassion for him is not merely empty rhetoric.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1214 (Number of characters: 466):
And typically when I slow
down and go inside, I find that old pain of self-abandonment - that old pain that I now think of as
“being lonely for myself.” Often this brings up some tears. Almost as often, crying initiates a
release from my flashback. Flexible Use Of The Flashback Management Steps
Helen started her session in a deep state of self-alienation: “I am just such a hopeless case! For
no reason at all, I got myself stuck in a terrible flashback yesterday.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1215 (Number of characters: 100):
And it wasn’t one of those
impossible-to-figure-out, waking up-flashbacks you keep telling me about.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1216 (Number of characters: 37):
I was fine all
morning, and then Bam!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1217 (Number of characters: 60):
I was in it up to here, and there wasn’t any stupid trigger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1218 (Number of characters: 18):
Nothing
caused it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1219 (Number of characters: 13):
It’s just me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1220 (Number of characters: 22):
Hopelessly screwed up!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1221 (Number of characters: 325):
Mentally defective!” Discerning the trigger of a flashback is a slippery slope. Seeing the trigger can often rescue
us from blaming and hating ourselves for the flashback, but there is not always an identifiable
trigger. In such situations, looking for the trigger can quickly deteriorate into self-pathologizing
vivisection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1222 (Number of characters: 100):
This slippery slope can quickly become a cliff as we plummet deeper into the abyss
of the flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1223 (Number of characters: 44):
It is almost always a matter of perspective.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1224 (Number of characters: 512):
Am I trigger-searching from a place of being on
my side or a place of fault-finding? When it is the latter, it is best to abandon the search and
move toward invoking self-acceptance, as there will always be triggerings that are unfathomable. The process of self-support needs to trump the healthy urge to “figure it ALL out” at such times. The process of self-acceptance also needs to trump any of your efforts to fix the flashback
when this striving becomes tainted with self-irritation and self-disappointment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1225 (Number of characters: 146):
Sometimes, as
described above, the best understanding you can achieve is an overarching one that your inner
child is feeling profoundly abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1226 (Number of characters: 151):
She is cowering from a humiliating attack from your
critic and needs for you to switch gears and demonstrate that you will care for her no matter
what.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1227 (Number of characters: 138):
Existential Triggers
Many psychologists use the term existential to describe the fact that all human beings are subject
to painful events.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1228 (Number of characters: 565):
These are normal recurring afflictions that everyone suffers from time to time. Horrible world events, difficult choices, illnesses and periodic feelings of abject loneliness are
common examples of existential pain. Existential calamities can be especially triggering for
survivors, because we typically have so much family-of-origin calamity for them to trigger us
into reliving. Another particularly triggering existential phenomenon is the fact that we all suffer
invisible, unpredictable mood shifts. Good moods sometimes inexplicably deteriorate into bad
ones.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1229 (Number of characters: 106):
As novelist, David Mitchell wrote “Good moods are as fragile as eggs… and bad moods as
fragile as bricks”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1230 (Number of characters: 82):
Unpredictable shifts in your emotional weather are typically problematic in Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1231 (Number of characters: 67):
These
shifts can quickly trigger you into a full-fledged flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1232 (Number of characters: 425):
This is usually because you were
punished or abandoned in the past for showing your full complement of feelings. So now, out of
old habit, you automatically dissociate when your emotional weather is inclement. The inner child often experiences this as you reverting to the pre-recovery adult who had no
time for feelings. The child then feels that he is once again trapped in the past where he was so
devastatingly abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1233 (Number of characters: 78):
Perhaps, the resultant flashback is his only way to really get your
attention.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1234 (Number of characters: 638):
This is, again, why I try to make my default position turning to myself and my inner
child with unconditional positive regard as much as possible. Later Stage Recovery
When your recovery matures sufficiently, you realize that much of the emotional pain of your
flashbacks is appropriate but delayed reactions to your childhood abuse and neglect. You process
your feelings in a way that resolves flashbacks, and also builds an increasingly healthy, sense of
self. This, in turn, leads to an ongoing reduction of the unresolved childhood pain that fuels your
emotional flashbacks. Flashbacks then become less frequent, intense and enduring.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1235 (Number of characters: 700):
Eventually,
you learn to invoke your self-protective instinct as soon as you realize that you are triggered. As
flashbacks decrease and become more manageable, the defensive structures built around them
(narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, dissociative and/or codependent) are more readily
deconstructed. At this stage of your recovery, you may now experience an ironically satisfying experience
when you come out of a flashback. You may sense on many levels of your awareness that life as
a child in your parents’ house was even worse than you realized. Simultaneously, you may feel a

corresponding sense of relief that you are now freer from your parents’ life-spoiling influence
than ever before.

SHRINKING THE INNER CRITIC
This chapter explores what one of my clients calls the “nasty and sneaky tricks of the critic.” ORIGIN OF THE CPTSD CRITIC
A flashback-inducing critic is typically spawned in a danger-ridden childhood home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1278 (Number of characters: 583):
This is true
whether the danger comes from the passive abandonment of neglect or the active abandonment
of abuse. When parents do not provide safe enough bonding and positive feedback, the child
flounders in anxiety and fear. Many children appear to be hard-wired to adapt to this
endangering abandonment with perfectionism. A prevailing climate of danger forces the child’s superego to over-cultivate the various
programs of perfectionism and endangerment listed below. Once again, the superego is the part
of the psyche that learns parental rules in order to gain their acceptance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1279 (Number of characters: 499):
The inner critic is the superego gone bad. The inner critic is the superego in overdrive
desperately trying to win your parents’ approval. When perfectionist striving fails to win
welcoming from your parents, the inner critic becomes increasingly hostile and caustic. It festers
into a virulent inner voice that increasingly manifests self-hate, self-disgust and self-
abandonment. The inner critic blames you incessantly for shortcomings that it imagines to be the
cause of your parents’ rejection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1280 (Number of characters: 535):
It is incapable of understanding that the real cause lies in your
parents’ shortcomings. As a traumatized child, your over-aroused sympathetic nervous system also drives you to
become increasingly hypervigilant. Hypervigilance is a fixation on looking for danger that comes
from excessive exposure to real danger. In an effort to recognize, predict and avoid danger,
hypervigilance is ingrained in your approach to being in the world. Hypervigilance narrows your
attention into an incessant, on-guard scanning of the people around you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1281 (Number of characters: 458):
It also frequently
projects you into the future, imagining danger in upcoming social events. Moreover,

hypervigilance typically devolves into intense performance anxiety on every level of self-
expression. Like the soldier overlong in combat, ptsd sets in because you feel as if you are constantly
under attack. Unfortunately, internal attack is now added to external attack, and you become
locked into hypervigilance and sympathetic nervous system arousal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1282 (Number of characters: 257):
A traumatized child becomes desperate to relieve the anxiety and depression of abandonment. The critic-driven child can only think about the ways she is too much or not enough. The child’s
unfolding sense of self [the healthy ego], finds no room to develop.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1283 (Number of characters: 42):
Her identity virtually
becomes the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1284 (Number of characters: 28):
The superego trumps the ego.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1285 (Number of characters: 256):
In this process, the critic becomes increasingly virulent and eventually switches from the
parents’ internalized voice: “You’re a bad boy/girl” to the first person: “I’m a bad boy/girl.” Over time, self-goading increasingly deteriorates: “I’m such a loser.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1286 (Number of characters: 59):
I’m so pathetic… bad...
ugly…worthless…stupid...defective.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1287 (Number of characters: 73):
This is unlike the soldier in combat who does not develop a toxic critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1288 (Number of characters: 102):
This process
whereby the superego becomes carcinogenic is a key juncture where ptsd morphs into Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1289 (Number of characters: 78):
The cruel, totalitarian inner critic is a key distinguishing feature of Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1290 (Number of characters: 402):
One of my clients grief-fully remembered the constant refrains of his childhood: “If only I
wasn’t so needy and selfish…if only my freckles would fade...if only I could pitch a perfect
game...if only I could stop gagging on the canned peas during dinner...if only I could pray all the
time to get mom’s arthritis cured, then maybe she’d stop picking on me, and then maybe dad
would play catch with me.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1291 (Number of characters: 237):
In my work with survivors, I am continuously struck by how often the inner critic triggers them
into overwhelming emotional flashbacks. The Cptsd-derived inner critic weds our fear of
abandonment to our self-hate about our imperfections.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1292 (Number of characters: 81):
It then tortures us with the entwined
serpents of perfectionism and endangerment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1293 (Number of characters: 88):
Endangerment is the process of constantly
projecting danger onto safe enough situations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1294 (Number of characters: 107):
Your recovering depends on learning how to recognize and confront the 14 inner critic
attacks listed below.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1295 (Number of characters: 193):
When this process of recovering is bypassed, these deeply engrained
programs continue to send you tumbling back into the overwhelming fear, shame and
hopelessness of your childhood abandonment.

chunk 1296 (Number of characters: 277):
14 COMMON INNER CRITIC ATTACKS [Each attack/program is paired with a therapeutic thought-correction response]
Perfectionism Attacks
1. Perfectionism. My perfectionism arose as an attempt to gain safety and support in my

dangerous family. Perfection is a self-persecutory myth.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1297 (Number of characters: 189):
I do not have to be perfect to be safe or
loved in the present. I am letting go of relationships that require perfection. I have a right to
make mistakes. Mistakes do not make me a mistake.

--------------------------------------------------

Once you become proficient at identifying

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1372 (Number of characters: 608):
This is essential because most survivors spend tremendous amounts of time barely
conscious of how incessantly self-critical they are. As with the flashback management steps, memorizing these rebuttals to the critic and using
them like mantras is especially helpful in critic shrinking. Critic-initiated Flashbacks
The inner critic commonly increases the intensity of a flashback via a barrage of the attacks
listed above. Flashbacks can devolve into increasingly painful levels of the abandonment
depression. One attack can repetitively bleed into another and tumble us further down a spiral of
hopelessness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1373 (Number of characters: 120):
It is awful enough to take a single punch in a fight, but when the punches keep

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1376 (Number of characters: 155):
My client, Dmitri, began his session by telling me that he was contentedly puttering around
his kitchen when he accidentally knocked over a glass of water.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1377 (Number of characters: 301):
He immediately pictured his
father and a loud internal voice blurted: “I’m such a world class spaz!” Retrospectively, he realized that he then plummeted instantly into a flashback. Anxiety

quickly overwhelmed him and he was soon lost in a tirade of self-attacking diatribes emanating
from the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1378 (Number of characters: 72):
“Spaz” is an example of the name-calling that the critic specializes in.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1379 (Number of characters: 57):
It is a
combination of critic attacks # 1, 3 and 9 above.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1380 (Number of characters: 89):
The attacks soon deteriorated into a full scale laundry listing of all his imperfections.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1381 (Number of characters: 83):
These
were characteristically blown out of proportion, and often not reality based.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1382 (Number of characters: 36):
The critic screamed:
“I’m so clumsy.

chunk 1384 (Number of characters: 31):
“I could f*ck up a free
lunch!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1385 (Number of characters: 193):
Quickly, Dmitri’s thinking was totally dominated by a negative focus[#11] that merged
with drasticizing [#10], and culminated in attack fantasies [#14] that made him cancel his plans
to go out.

partner or any friends; who could tolerate being around such a loser” [#2: He actually had two

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1393 (Number of characters: 124):
I must emphasize here that Dmitri was not crazy or defective because his critic made a hell
out of a spilled glass of water.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1394 (Number of characters: 225):
All this was a re-visit via flashback to the real traumatic
experiences of being profoundly rejected by his parents for trivial mistakes. His father had
contemptuously told him he could f*ck up a free lunch innumerable times.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1395 (Number of characters: 137):
As Dmitri resolved and harvested the learning potential of this flashback, he said to me:
“Pete, I can’t tell you how horrible they were.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1396 (Number of characters: 63):
Life at home was one no-win, mind-f*ck situation
after another.

--------------------------------------------------

me and I swear I’m gonna start cutting myself some slack!”
Thoughts As Triggers
Rejecting parents typically make the child believe that his opinions and feelings are dangerous
imperfections. In worst case scenarios the mere impulse to speak triggers fear and shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1400 (Number of characters: 77):
How
could anything the child says not reveal his stupidity and worthlessness?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1401 (Number of characters: 67):
Opening his mouth
invariably leads to deeper rejection and trouble.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1402 (Number of characters: 185):
As ongoing neglect and abuse repetitively strengthen the critic, even the most innocuous,
self-interested thought or musing can trigger a five alarm fire of intense emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1403 (Number of characters: 152):
To
maintain the illusive hope of someday winning parental approval, the child’s perfectionistic
striving escalates, and may become obsessive/compulsive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1404 (Number of characters: 55):
Even an imagined mistake can then
initiate a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1405 (Number of characters: 206):
The Critic As The Shaming Internalized Parents
Not infrequently, a client comes into a session and shamefully confesses something that sounds

like this: “I called myself a f*ckwit over and over last night.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1406 (Number of characters: 80):
I must really be inherently messed
up, because I know my mother never said that.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1407 (Number of characters: 78):
As bad as she was, she never swore and I doubt
she ever even heard that word.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1408 (Number of characters: 366):
The explanation for this is that the critic is essentially a process. It is an ever developing
process that co-opts our creativity and funnels it into “new and improved” ways of imitating our
parents’ disparagement. Parental contempt is the key piece of the emotional abuse that creates toxic shame. Toxic
shame is the emotional matrix of the abandonment depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1409 (Number of characters: 460):
It is also the glue that keeps us
stuck helplessly in flashbacks. As such, toxic shame is the affect or emotional tone of the inner
critic. Shame besmirches us as it emotionally intensifies each of the 14 assaults described above. In main stream psychology, shame is often described as a social emotion. Normal shame is
a somewhat healthy, self-regulating emotional reaction that arises when someone witnesses us
acting in an unfair, offensive, or hurtful way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1410 (Number of characters: 46):
This is not the case with toxic shame however.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1411 (Number of characters: 124):
Many Cptsd survivors in recovery soon
realize that they do not need a witness to suddenly be catapulted into a shame attack.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1412 (Number of characters: 52):
Dmitri was all alone when he knocked over the glass.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1413 (Number of characters: 438):
Or was he? There is an invisible social context to toxic shame attacks. Toxic shame is social
because the inner critic came into existence through pathological interactions with our parents. Moreover, toxic shame is social in the moment of the solitary flashback, because at the time it is
as if we are in the presence of our parents. For me, the strongest evidence of this occurs when I am on my own and trying to do
something difficult.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1414 (Number of characters: 362):
If I make a mistake or do not accomplish my task as efficiently as possible, I
often feel very anxious as if I am being watched and criticized. I believe this phenomenon corresponds with an internalization of our parents. Our parents
were such formative and formidable presences in our developing life, that we have strong
representations of them in our psyches.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1415 (Number of characters: 70):
These representations include their beliefs and
condemnation about us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1416 (Number of characters: 408):
Until we work on shrinking their influence, our internalized parents exist
in our psyches as the key controlling force of our lives. Facing The Stubbornness Of The Critic
The work of shrinking the critic is one of the most essential processes of recovery. As obvious as
its value may seem as you read this, embracing the task of renouncing the critic is much more
challenging than it may seem at first blush.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1417 (Number of characters: 160):
The critic’s programs are not only burned deeply into our psyches by our parents, but we
also unknowingly emblazon them into our minds by mimicking our parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1418 (Number of characters: 60):
We are now the key
reinforcing agents of their toxic legacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1419 (Number of characters: 119):
With little mindfulness of it, we injure ourselves with
countless angry, self-disgusted repetitions of their judgments.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1420 (Number of characters: 124):
Recovery now depends on you
withdrawing your blind allegiance to this terrible process of only noticing yourself negatively.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1421 (Number of characters: 65):
The task of diminishing these self-negating patterns is daunting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1422 (Number of characters: 106):
It is typically lifetime work
– often negotiable only at the rate of two-steps-forward, one-step backward.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1423 (Number of characters: 73):
And oh how unfair
it is that the step backward often feels more like six!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1424 (Number of characters: 35):
Yet recent findings in neuroscience

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1425 (Number of characters: 182):
[The General Theory of Love; The Talking Cure] have
shown that biologically ingrained mental patterns can be diminished and replaced with new ones

through long term repetitive work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1426 (Number of characters: 162):
I believe this is analogous to adding or subtracting girth to
parts of your physique, which typically takes seemingly innumerable repetitions of a given
exercise.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1427 (Number of characters: 132):
In the last couple of decades my brain has gone from being my own worst enemy almost all
the time to being very reliably on my side.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1428 (Number of characters: 533):
I have also seen similar gains with many of the clients
I have worked with long-term. Perfectionism And Emotional Neglect As stated earlier, perfectionism also seems to be an instinctual defense for emotionally
abandoned children. The existential impossibility of perfection saves the child from giving up,
unless or until lack of success forces her to retreat into a dissociative freeze response or an anti-
social fight response. Perfectionism also provides a sense of meaning and direction for the powerless and
unsupported child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1429 (Number of characters: 68):
Striving to be perfect offers her a semblance of a sense of control.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1430 (Number of characters: 463):
Self-
control is also safer to pursue because abandoning parents typically reserve their severest
punishment for children who are vocal about their negligence. As the quest for perfection fails over and over, and as parental acceptance and nurturing
remain elusive, imperfection becomes synonymous with shame and fear. Perceived imperfection
triggers fear of abandonment, which triggers self-hate for imperfection, which expands
abandonment into self-abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1431 (Number of characters: 84):
This in turn amps fear up even further, which in turn
intensifies self-disgust, etc.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1432 (Number of characters: 78):
On and on it goes in a downward spiral of fear and shame-encrusted
depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1433 (Number of characters: 110):
It can go on for hours, days, weeks, and for those with severe Cptsd, can become
their standard mode of being.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1434 (Number of characters: 745):
More On Endangerment
The importance and magnitude of the critic’s endangerment programs cannot be overstated. I
have worked with numerous “well-therapized” people who were relatively free from
perfectionism, but still seriously afflicted with the critic’s addiction to noticing potential danger. Said another way, I have seen survivors eliminate much of their perfectionist, self-attacking
thinking without realizing that the critic was still flooding their minds with fear-inducing
thoughts and images. I learned to disidentify from perfectionism long before I learned to stop perseverating on
my critic’s harrowing snapshots of danger. In fact, I became quite adept at morphing these
snapshots into feature long films about my imminent demise.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1435 (Number of characters: 494):
Permanent abandonment, public humiliation, lethal illness, lonely death, imminent attack,
and penniless homelessness are common endangerment themes of many survivors. One of my
clients identified his inner critic endangerment process as: “My critic, the horror movie
producer”. This made me think: “My critic the terrorist”. If I had to describe the two most key processes of the critic, I would say this. First, the critic
is above all a self-perpetuating process of extreme negative noticing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1436 (Number of characters: 293):
Second the critic is a
constant hypervigilance that sees disaster hovering in the next moment about to launch into a
full-court-press. Using Anger To Thought-Stop The Critic
Thought-stopping is the process of using willpower to disidentify from and interrupt toxic
thoughts and visualizations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1437 (Number of characters: 88):
Sometimes visualizing a stop sign at the same time can help
strengthen thought-stopping.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1438 (Number of characters: 582):
Since traumatizing parents cripple the instinctive fight response of their child, recovering
the anger of the fight response is essential in healing Cptsd. We need the aid of our fight
response to empower the process of thought-stopping the critic. I cannot over-encourage you to use your anger to stop the critic in its tracks. We can re-
hijack the anger of the critic’s attack, and forcefully redirect it at the critic instead of ourselves. We can then silently and internally say “No!” or “Stop!” or “Shut Up!” to short-circuit
drasticizing and perfectionistic mental processes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1439 (Number of characters: 100):
Angrily saying “No!” to the critic sets an internal boundary against unnatural, anti-self
processes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1440 (Number of characters: 262):
It is the hammer of self-renovating carpentry that rebuilds our instinct of self-
protection. Furthermore recovery is deepened by directing our anger at anyone who helped
install the critic, as well as at anyone who is currently contributing to keeping it alive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1441 (Number of characters: 252):
I recently received this e-mail from a website respondent who read some of my writing about
angering at the critic: “Another explanation I really liked is for people that don’t have much of
the FIGHT response to start using it to stop the inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1442 (Number of characters: 88):
I am a huge fan of self-compassion
which has really helped me recently (loving-kindness)

--------------------------------------------------

wasn’t messages I would have given to myself, and they are all messages from my parents.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1451 (Number of characters: 91):
Successful critic-shrinking usually requires thousands of angry skirmishes with the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1452 (Number of characters: 105):
Passionate motivation for this work often arises when we construct an accurate picture of our
upbringing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1453 (Number of characters: 136):
Natural anger eventually arises when we really get how little and defenseless we
were when our parents bullied us into hating ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1454 (Number of characters: 584):
Most trauma survivors were blank slates who were brainwashed into accepting the critic as
their primary identity. To the degree that a family is Cptsd-engendering, to that degree is it like a
mini-cult. Cults demand absolute loyalty to the leader’s authority and belief system. In early
thought-stopping work, most survivors need to empower their efforts with a healthy rage against
their parents for destroying their self-loyalty and their self-individuation. However, with enough
practice, the survivor’s healthy observing ego can use willpower alone to disidentify from the
critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1455 (Number of characters: 108):
My son’s birth graced me with an enormous boost in my motivation to practice thought-stopping
on the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1456 (Number of characters: 118):
Witnessing the many miracles of his ongoing development moved me to
increasingly deepen my emotional bonding with him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1457 (Number of characters: 194):
This was quite disconcerting to my critic
which began working overtime on its endangerment programs. The critic warned me interminably about the danger of my rapidly expanding attachment to
him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1458 (Number of characters: 146):
It was trying to protect me from the devastation that would ensue if my loving emotional
investment turned out as badly as it did with my parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1459 (Number of characters: 70):
What if untrustworthy “Life” let him
die or rendered him a “bad seed.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1460 (Number of characters: 131):
The critic manufactured the most dreadful horror movies of accidents, diseases, kidnapping,
mental illness, oedipal betrayals, etc.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1461 (Number of characters: 174):
Had I not known how to recognize, interpret and refuse to
indulge these catastrophizations, I am sure that my capacity to bond with him would have been
seriously compromised.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1462 (Number of characters: 150):
Moreover, had I not been able to use my outrage to disidentify from the
critic, thought-stopping by itself would not have been a powerful enough tool.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1463 (Number of characters: 55):
I particularly like this way of challenging the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1464 (Number of characters: 44):
“I’m not afraid of you anymore, mom and
dad.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1465 (Number of characters: 50):
You were the critic, and you put the critic in me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1466 (Number of characters: 65):
I renounce your toxic messages. Take back
your shame and disgust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1467 (Number of characters: 50):
I am disgusted at your shameful job of parenting.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1468 (Number of characters: 115):
One of my clients shared with me a phrase that spontaneously came to her while she was
fighting her critic at home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1469 (Number of characters: 98):
“You totally ruined my childhood, and I’m not going to let you get
away with ruining my life now.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1470 (Number of characters: 546):
She reported that this perspective emblazoned in her
consciousness, and now often helps to fire her up to fire the critic. Shame Is Blame Unfairly Turned Against The Self
The great psychologist, Erik Eriksen, gave us a great tool when he formulated this emotional
mathematics equation. “Shame is blame turned against the self”. Our parents were too big and
powerful to blame, so we had to blame ourselves instead. Now, however we are free of them,
and we can cut off the critic’s shame supply by redirecting unfair self-blame back to our parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1471 (Number of characters: 392):
You can redirect the anger of the critic’s blaming messages away from you. You can direct
the anger onto the installers of the critic, or sideways onto the critic itself. You can give shame
back by allowing yourself to feel angry and disgusted at the image of your parent bullying you. You can rage at them for overwhelming you with shame when you were too young and small to
defend yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1472 (Number of characters: 116):
An inner critic that has dominated us since childhood, however, does not give up its
rulership of the psyche easily.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1473 (Number of characters: 142):
It stubbornly refuses to accept the updated information that
adulthood now offers the possibility of increasing safety and healthy attachment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1474 (Number of characters: 102):
It is as if the
critic has worn a flashback-inducing groove in the brain the size of the Grand Canyon.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1475 (Number of characters: 131):
Now, any
of the thinking patterns listed earlier can hair-trigger an amygdala-hijacking that dumps us into
the abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1476 (Number of characters: 86):
Progress in critic-shrinking is often infinitesimally slow and indiscernible at first.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1477 (Number of characters: 85):
Our
brains have become addicted to only noticing what is wrong and what is dangerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1478 (Number of characters: 99):
And as with
most addictions, breaking this deeply entrenched habit may require lifelong management.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1479 (Number of characters: 407):
In early recovery work, we need to challenge the critic’s monocular negative focus over and
over with all the ferocity we can muster. Eventually with practice we can find a part of ourselves
that is mad about how grossly unfair our parents’ bullying and indifference was. We can find a
part of us that is outraged that we were indoctrinated and inculcated into chronically abandoning
and bullying ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1480 (Number of characters: 103):
We can fume that this occurred when we were too young to protest or
even know what was happening to us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1481 (Number of characters: 62):
We can gradually build our ability to say “No!” and “Shut
up!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1482 (Number of characters: 512):
whenever we catch the critic attacking us. With enough healthy inner self-defense, the survivor gradually learns to reject her
unconscious acceptance of self-abuse and self-abandonment. Her sense of healthy self-protection
begins to emerge and over time grows into a fierce willingness to stop unfair criticism - internal
or external. Psychologically speaking, this is part of the process of working through repetition
compulsion. Deconstructing repetition compulsion has both an internal and external dimension.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1483 (Number of characters: 273):
On the internal dimension, we decrease the habit of repetitively perpetrating our parents’ abuse
against ourselves by staunchly confronting the inner critic. This then allows us to become more
mindful on the external dimension when others reenact our parents’ mistreatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1484 (Number of characters: 65):
We can then
confront them to stop, or banish them from our lives.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1485 (Number of characters: 525):
With enough practice, we can repudiate our
parents’ awful legacy of teaching us that love means numbly accepting abuse and neglect. Further encouragement and guidance for therapeutically angering at the critic can be found
in Soul Without Shame, by Byron Brown, and Healing Your Emotional Self by Beverly Engel. Embracing The Critic
In my experience, until the fight response is substantially restored, the Cptsd client benefits little
from CBT, psychodynamic or mindfulness techniques that encourage us to accept the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1486 (Number of characters: 126):
In
later recovery, when the survivor has removed the venomous stinger from the critic, these
techniques can be quite valuable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1487 (Number of characters: 505):
Then, and only then, are we able to reconnect with the helpful
side of healthy self-criticism [see Stone and Stone’s book Embracing Your Inner Critic]. A typical indication that the critic has mellowed into being functional is that it speaks to us
in a kind and helpful voice. It reminds us dispassionately to adjust our behavior when we can and
ought to be doing something better. If, however, it blasts us for imperfection, it is giving itself
away as the toxic critic that was installed by our parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1488 (Number of characters: 457):
A left-brained, objective approach of embracing the critic is rarely helpful unless it is
balanced with a subjective, right-brained capacity for assertive self-protection. Perhaps this is
because the inner critic appears to operate simultaneously with hyper-emotional right-brain
flashback dynamics. Perhaps toxic inner critic processes are so emotionally overwhelming that
efforts to resist them rationally and dispassionately are too weak to be effective.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1489 (Number of characters: 422):
THOUGHT-SUBSTITUTION AND THOUGHT-CORRECTION
Thought-substitution, especially in the form of thought-correction, is another essential tool for
empowering the work of thought-stopping the critic. Many years ago, I sensed that my critic
became as tough as a body-builder’s bicep through myriad repetitions. I guessed that similarly
exercising self-protective responses to the critic would build my thought-correction muscles.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1490 (Number of characters: 127):
It

did in fact, and my instinct to protect myself almost always arises automatically now when I am
triggered into a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1491 (Number of characters: 174):
I believe I am not exaggerating when I say that tens of thousands of
positive thought-substitutions have rewarded me with a psyche that is fairly consistently user-
friendly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1492 (Number of characters: 158):
Accordingly, I encourage you to immediately confront the critic’s negative messages with
positive ones like those in the list at the beginning of the chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1493 (Number of characters: 573):
This is essential in Cptsd
recovery, because a single unconfronted toxic thought can act like a virus and rage infectiously
out of control into a flu-like mélange of shame, fear and helplessness. Moving quickly into thought-stopping and thought correction often obviates a headlong
tumble into the downward spiral of a flashback. This is essential in critic-work, as the critic
typically attacks us more viciously once it has gotten up a head of steam. At such times, the critic
can hypocritically scorn us for falling back into self-criticism when we “should” know better.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1494 (Number of characters: 127):
This is the time then, more than ever, to “thought-correct and not self-berate,” as my last intern
liked to say to her clients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1495 (Number of characters: 149):
Additionally, I encourage you to write out a list of your positive qualities and
accomplishments to read it to yourself if you get lost in self-hate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1496 (Number of characters: 106):
Toolbox 5 in chapter 16 is a
practical exercise to help you elaborate this list in a multidimensional way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1497 (Number of characters: 257):
Making a written record of your positive attributes is especially helpful as flashbacks often
create a temporary amnesia about your essential worthiness and goodness. Flashbacks seem to
involve a temporary loss of access to more current left-brain learning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1498 (Number of characters: 80):
MRI’s show greatly
reduced left-brain activity in hyper-aroused Cptsd survivors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1499 (Number of characters: 241):
In my experience, memorizing your
list enhances your capacity to dissolve that amnesia. Reciting part or all of your list over and over like a mantra can also help you during those
times when the critic is particularly severe and relentless.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1500 (Number of characters: 106):
If you have trouble making the list or
filling out Toolbox 5, ask a friend or a therapist for their input.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1501 (Number of characters: 120):
Additionally, please let me
remind you that qualities do not have to be perfect or ever-present to qualify as qualities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1502 (Number of characters: 60):
If it is
true of you most of the time then, it is a quality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1503 (Number of characters: 82):
Finally, positive visualization can be a powerful adjunct to thought-substitution.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1504 (Number of characters: 221):
Some
survivors gradually learn to short-circuit the fear-mongering processes of the critic by invoking
images of past successes and accomplishments, as well as picturing safe places, loving friends or
comforting memories.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1505 (Number of characters: 633):
There are also a variety of CD’s available at places like Amazon.com that
contain guided meditations that use positive language and imagery in a way that enhances
deactivation and relaxation. Perspective-Substitution And Correction
The most important thought correction of all is a switch in the perspective of our thinking. Perspective-substitution is a broadening of our overall perspective. It moves our viewpoint
from the critic’s narrow, negative focus to the more balanced and accurate focus of the observing
ego – the mindful self. Perspective-substitution helps us to dethrone the critic from its life-negating point of view.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1506 (Number of characters: 740):
This resembles the firing of a bad manager or inept coach – one with a distorted view who dwells
so much on what is wrong that he cannot see anything that is right. As stated in chapter 1, perspective-substitution can be enhanced with the spiritual practice

of gratitude. In this vein, gratitude is a type of mindfulness that looks for empirical proof that life
is essentially good even though it is also quite difficult at times. Perspective-Substitution And Gratitude
Gratitude is a delicate subject to write about because many survivors have been abused by
shaming advice to “just be grateful for what you have”. Consequently many survivors totally
reject the concept of gratitude and throw the baby out with the scorn-sodden bathwater.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1507 (Number of characters: 303):
Once
again, this is quite understandable when you legitimately had little to be grateful for in your
childhood. Moreover, the concept of gratitude is damagingly used by some psychologists to support the
psychological defense of denial. They tout gratitude as a fast track that can bypass traumatic
pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1508 (Number of characters: 58):
This is worse than absurd when applied to Cptsd survivors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1509 (Number of characters: 526):
It is in fact shamefully abusive
to survivors because profound, extended trauma cannot be resolved until it is fully understood
and worked through. Gratitude is nevertheless a wonderful natural experience that can recurrently enhance the
quality of your life. You can cultivate a perspective that is open to noticing what there is to be
grateful about as long as you do not do it with the intention of creating a permanent feeling of
gratitude. Over time an attitude of gratitude can gradually increase authentic gratefulness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1510 (Number of characters: 542):
This can best be illustrated with the example of love. While it is of course healthy to adopt a
cognitive attitude of love toward our friends and chosen family, it is impossible to feel loving all
the time. If I expect that of myself, I give my inner critic endless fodder to attack me for not
feeling loving enough. Similarly if I expect myself to feel grateful all the time, I keep the critic’s
prodigious program of self-disappointment hale and hearty. Nonetheless, aligning with attitudes like love and gratitude is generally therapeutic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1511 (Number of characters: 425):
When I
am temporarily stuck in a flashback feeling alienated from life, remembering what I am usually
grateful for in life can sometimes pull me out of the polarized negative thinking that helps keep
the flashback alive. Invoking gratitude is particularly difficult, and often impossible at first, because flashbacks
typically strand us in an emotional overwhelm that cancels out our ability to feel anything good
about life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1512 (Number of characters: 567):
Reminding ourselves of what is worthwhile in our lives does not seem to help much in
the early phases of using this tool. However, with enough practice of positive-noticing, we can
sometimes relax out of a flashback by invoking our memories of gratitude. When I experience this at the end of an especially long flashback, positive-noticing
sometimes arises spontaneously and brings with it sweet tears of gratitude. These are also
typically tears of relief, and tears of an achieved sense of belonging. These tears typically arise unbidden, seemingly out of the blue.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1513 (Number of characters: 771):
Typically they are
positively triggered by experiences of beauty or connection, such as when flowers authentically
strike me as beautiful once again, or when my appreciation of music returns and deeply moves
my soul, or when I suddenly fully feel how much I love my wife, my son, my friend or my client. After a painful lapse in being able to emotionally enjoy these experiences, this return brings
these gratitude-laden tears which on really momentous occasions can vacillate between crying
and laughing as I resurface into authentically being grateful to be alive. Once again, my experience is that the more I practice the thought substitution of focusing on
what I am grateful for, the sooner genuine gratitude returns to me on the occasions that I lose
touch with it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1514 (Number of characters: 64):
A powerful way to practice perspective-correction is as follows.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1515 (Number of characters: 192):
After you go to bed at
night, list at least ten positive happenings of the day. More often than not these will not be peak
experiences, but rather basic and simple pleasures and appreciations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1516 (Number of characters: 302):
They may be as simple as a
catchy tune, an engaging color, a sweet scent, an enjoyable food serving of the day, a new flower
in a local garden, a satisfying TV show, a neighbor’s hello, a feeling of fitness climbing the
stairs, soothing words from a favorite author, or a pleasant encounter with a pet.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1517 (Number of characters: 113):
Decades of this practice have helped me immeasurably to upgrade the sour perspective I
inherited from my parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1518 (Number of characters: 384):
Alignment with this function of the healthy observing ego provides us
with a more balanced and accurate perception of life and other people. The Neuroplasticity Of The Brain
I am repeatedly heartened to read the accumulating evidence from neuroscience research that
proves the neuroplasticity of the brain. Neuroplasticity means that the brain can grow and change
throughout our life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1519 (Number of characters: 95):
Old self-destructive neural pathways can be diminished and new healthier
ones can replace them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1520 (Number of characters: 74):
A General Theory of Love by Thomas Lewis inspiringly explicates this
fact.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1521 (Number of characters: 295):
This fact helps me to remember that the critic can indeed literally be shrunk via longterm,
frequent and dedicated use of the thought-stopping, thought-substitution and thought-correction
practices. As recovery progresses, you notice the critic sooner before its attack becomes multidimensional.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1522 (Number of characters: 562):
This then allows you to take more immediate self-protective action. Moreover, Cptsd flashbacks
can be utilized as evidence of, and in later stages of recovery, proof of your childhood
traumatization. Flashbacks point irrefutably to the fact that your parent’s abandonment forced
you to habituate to hypervigilance and negative noticing. SHRINKING THE OUTER CRITIC
THE OUTER CRITIC: THE ENEMY OF RELATIONSHIP
In Cptsd, the critic can have two aspects: inner critic and outer critic. The inner critic is the part
of your mind that views you as flawed and unworthy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1523 (Number of characters: 179):
The outer critic is the part that views
everyone else as flawed and unworthy. When the outer critic is running your mind, people
appear to be too awful and too dangerous to trust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1524 (Number of characters: 109):
When she was stuck in an outer critic attack, one of my clients would often rant like this:
“Everybody s*cks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1525 (Number of characters: 32):
People are so selfish and scary.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1526 (Number of characters: 48):
They either f*ck you over or they let you
down.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1527 (Number of characters: 70):
She eventually named this an “I’m-moving-to-another-planet flashback.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1528 (Number of characters: 535):
The outer critic is the counterpart of the self-esteem-destroying inner critic. It uses the same
programs of perfectionism and endangerment against others that your inner critic uses against
yourself. Via its all-or-none programming, the outer critic rejects others because they are never
perfect and cannot be guaranteed to be safe. As with the inner critic, outer critic attacks are usually internal and silent, unless you are a
fight type as we will see below. When we regress into the outer critic, we obsess about the unworthiness

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1529 (Number of characters: 34):
[imperfection] and
treacherousness

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1530 (Number of characters: 26):
[dangerousness] of others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1531 (Number of characters: 519):
Unconsciously, we do this to avoid emotional
investment in relationships. The outer critic developed in reaction to parents who were too dangerous to trust. The outer
critic helped us to be hyperaware of the subtlest signal that our parents were deteriorating into
their most dangerous behaviors. Over time the outer critic grew to believe that anyone and
everyone would inevitably turn out to be as untrustworthy as our parents. Now, in situations where we no longer need it, the outer critic alienates us from others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1532 (Number of characters: 619):
It
attacks others and scares them away, or it builds fortresses of isolation whose walls are laundry
lists of their exaggerated shortcomings. In an awful irony, the critic attempts to protect us from

abandonment by scaring us further into it. If we are ever to discover the comfort of soothing connection with others, the critic’s
dictatorship of the mind must be broken. The outer critic’s arsenal of intimacy-spoiling dynamics
must be consciously identified and gradually deactivated. 4F TYPES AND OUTER CRITIC/INNER CRITIC RATIOS
Depending on your 4F type, you may gravitate to either the inner or the outer critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1533 (Number of characters: 325):
Different 4F
types generally have different ratios of outer and inner critic dynamics, and some polarize
extremely to one or the other. Freeze and Fight types are often polarized to the outer critic. Fawn types tend to be
dominated by the inner critic. Flight types can have the most variance in inner and outer critic
ratio.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1534 (Number of characters: 51):
Your subtype can also have a big influence on this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1535 (Number of characters: 128):
The Freeze type can judgmentally denounce the entire outside world to justify her all-or-
none belief that people are dangerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1536 (Number of characters: 525):
The Flight type can use his own perfectionistic striving to
excel so that his outer critic can judge everyone else as inferior. The Fawn type uses inner critic
self-hate to self-censor and avoid the fear of being authentic and vulnerable in relationship. The
Fight type, in a paradoxical twist, controls others through the outer critic to prevent them from
abandoning him while at the same time using prickliness to not let them get too close. Fight types can also leave at the first sign that the other cannot be controlled.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1537 (Number of characters: 100):
One flight-
fight type, who I worked with briefly, told me with great upset about a recent betrayal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1538 (Number of characters: 132):
His new
partner “insisted” on replacing the empty toilet paper roll so that the new roll unwound from the
bottom instead of the top.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1539 (Number of characters: 107):
He asked her once to do it his way and felt so betrayed when she did
not comply, that he broke up with her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1540 (Number of characters: 66):
I could not help feeling that she was fortunate that she got
away.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1541 (Number of characters: 102):
Unfortunately, this client was not able to take in that the lion’s share of his upset was a
flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1542 (Number of characters: 132):
He had flashed back to his rigidly controlling mother frightening him into believing
that the toilet paper must unwind from the top.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1543 (Number of characters: 68):
She had punished him into believing that this was
a universal truth.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1544 (Number of characters: 625):
Perfectionism, in the hands of the outer critic, can be paranoiacally picayune. Finally it is not unusual for survivors, who have significantly shrunk their dominant critic mode,
to experience a reciprocal increase in the virulence of its opposite counterpart. This came as a
disappointing shock to me at a time when I was congratulating myself that my inner critic was a
mere shadow of its former self. Soon thereafter, I noticed that I was plagued by a new
judgmentalness that seemed out of character. Curiosity and a growing mindfulness about this
development lead me to a lot of the insights that I share in this chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1545 (Number of characters: 412):
With enough
mindfulness, this shift in critic mode can then become an opportunity to further shrink the overall
combined agency of the outer and inner critic. PASSSIVE-AGGRESSIVENESS AND THE OUTER CRITIC
Children are initially wired to respond angrily to parental abuse or neglect. Outside of the fight

types, most traumatized children learn early that protesting parental unfairness is an
unpardonable offense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1546 (Number of characters: 160):
They are generally forced to repress their protests and complaints. This
then renders their anger silent and subliminal. This anger however, does not disappear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1547 (Number of characters: 409):
It
percolates as an ever accumulating sea of resentment that can fuel the outer critic’s obsession for
finding fault and seeing danger in everyone. Viewing all relationships through the lens of parental abandonment, the outer critic never
lets down its guard. It continuously transfers unexpressed childhood anger onto others, and
silently scapegoats them by blowing current disappointments out of proportion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1548 (Number of characters: 167):
Citing
insignificant transgressions as justification, the survivor flashes back into outer critic mode, and
silently fumes and grumbles in long judgmental ruminations.

To bastardize Elizabeth Barrett
Browning: “How do I find thee lacking?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1550 (Number of characters: 23):
Let me count the ways.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1551 (Number of characters: 646):
When silently blaming the wrong person becomes habitual, it manifests as passive-
aggressiveness. Common examples of passive aggression are distancing yourself in hurt
withdrawal, or pushing others away with backhanded compliments. Other examples include poor
listening, hurtful teasing disguised as joking, and the withholding of positive feedback and
appreciation. Chronic lateness and poor follow through on commitments can also be
unconscious, passive-aggressive ways of expressing anger to others. Refusing To Give Voice To The Critic’s Point Of View
The outer critic is the author of this intimacy-spoiling program: Being honest to a fault.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1552 (Number of characters: 98):
In the
guise of honesty, the outer critic can negatively notice only what is imperfect in another.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1553 (Number of characters: 129):
Under
the spell of perfectionism, the outer critic can tear the other apart by laundry-listing his normal
weaknesses and foibles.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1554 (Number of characters: 496):
When challenged about this many fight types will respond that: “I was
just trying to be honest!” The inner critic has its own version of excessive honesty which I sometimes call “beating
you to the punch.” Afraid of being criticized [as in childhood], the inner critic can launch the
survivor into a “confession” of her every defect in hopes of short-circuiting anyone else from
bringing them up. Sometimes hearing the criticism from yourself feels less hurtful than hearing it
from someone else.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1555 (Number of characters: 414):
After all, it’s old news to you and your critic. I subscribe to authenticity as one of my highest values, but it does not include sharing my
outer critic’s view of you or exposing my inner critic’s unfair judgments of me. As stated earlier, the toxic critic is not an authentic part of us. We were not born with it. We
were indoctrinated with it by parents who viewed us in an extremely negative and jaundiced
way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1556 (Number of characters: 95):
Because of this, we need to protect our intimates from its distorted and destructive
judgments.

OUTER CRITIC-DOMINATED FLASHBACKS
Holly, an elderly client and a flight-fight type, was suffering minor, age-related memory loss.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1559 (Number of characters: 100):
She started her session chuckling: “I was reading your article on the Outer Critic again last night.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1560 (Number of characters: 71):
I didn’t really get it when I read it three years ago, but I get it now

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1561 (Number of characters: 69):
and I think it’s because my
memory deterioration has a silver lining.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1562 (Number of characters: 85):
“So, you know how I’m always blaming my husband whenever anything goes wrong at
home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1563 (Number of characters: 92):
Well I’m starting to get that it’s an all-or-none, outer critic process that I get stuck in.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1564 (Number of characters: 144):
“I’ve been blaming him for misplacing or not putting things away for decades but I’ve
started to notice that it’s me who often misplaces things.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1565 (Number of characters: 104):
I was cooking a meal last night and
looking for the food scissors that I use to cut up leafy vegetables.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1566 (Number of characters: 192):
It wasn’t on the magnetic wall
strip where I insist that we keep it, and I immediately started feeling very angry at him - and
more and more angry as I searched in various drawers to no avail.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1567 (Number of characters: 115):
“The longer I searched, the more exasperated I got, and sure enough, I found myself
laundry-listing all his faults.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1568 (Number of characters: 107):
My resentment rapidly escalated and peaked with me deciding that I
really was going to leave him this time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1569 (Number of characters: 182):
As I continued to amass evidence that he was a terrible
loser and that this was a wise decision, I went back to the stove and found the scissors where I’d
left them five minutes ago.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1570 (Number of characters: 85):
I could see the scraps of spinach still on them from when I’d cut it up
over the pot!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1571 (Number of characters: 34):
“What a mortifying epiphany I had!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1572 (Number of characters: 86):
- Especially since a similar thing had happened with
the tooth paste the night before.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1573 (Number of characters: 145):
I forgot I had put it in the medicine cabinet in one of my
organizational upgrades, and I was convinced Frank had moved it from its proper place.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1574 (Number of characters: 106):
I started
reading him the riot act so intensely, that he pretended he had to get something out of the car.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1575 (Number of characters: 106):
And then, when I went to the medicine cabinet for some aspirin, there it was where I had placed
it myself!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1576 (Number of characters: 87):
“Oh my god, that outer critic did an instant about face into becoming the inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1577 (Number of characters: 194):
And
then when it had contemptuously lambasted me to tears, I suddenly had another epiphany about
how I would let any mistake on his part launch me into a two volume history of his past
mistakes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1578 (Number of characters: 160):
I’d get so stuck in that negative noticing that I couldn’t call to mind a single good thing
about this good enough husband that I’ve had for thirty-five years.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1579 (Number of characters: 57):
Holly and I spent a great deal of time fleshing this out.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1580 (Number of characters: 182):
She could see that the outer critic
typically triggered her into a very old feeling and belief that “People are so unreliable – they
always let you down –they just can’t be trusted!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1581 (Number of characters: 126):
We then moved into exploring her childhood, looking for clues as to where this belief that
people were so untrustworthy began.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1582 (Number of characters: 100):
She closed her eyes, took a few deep breaths, and when she
opened them tears trickled down her face.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1583 (Number of characters: 67):
“It was Father – Daddy - that incredibly selfish,
alcoholic a-hole.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1584 (Number of characters: 24):
Please pardon my French.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1585 (Number of characters: 156):
No matter where I’d hide my baby-sitting money
he’d always find it, and come home drunk later, crying about how sorry he was and how he’d
never do it again.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1586 (Number of characters: 31):
He’d even let me go off on him!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1587 (Number of characters: 32):
Oh my God, just like poor Frank!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1588 (Number of characters: 27):
Just sit
there and take it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1589 (Number of characters: 15):
Only poor Frank

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1590 (Number of characters: 55):
[more tears], he’s never done anything like that to me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1591 (Number of characters: 76):
He’s
pretty reliable in most ways, except for not being as organized as me.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1592 (Number of characters: 165):
OUTER CRITIC MODELLING IN THE MEDIA
Outer critic entrenchment is also difficult to dislodge because its parlance is normalized, and
worse, celebrated in our society.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1593 (Number of characters: 638):
Skewering people seems to be standard practice in most TV
comedies. Moreover, many influential, seemingly healthy adults model a communication style
that is rife with judgmentalness, sarcasm, negativity, fear-mongering and scapegoating. Giving control of our social interactions to the outer critic prohibits the cultivation of the
vulnerable communication that makes intimacy possible. We must renounce unconscious outer

critic strategies such as: [1] “I will use angry criticism to make you afraid of me, so I can be safe
from you”; [2] “Why should I bother with people when everyone is so selfish and corrupt” [all-
or-none thinking];

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1594 (Number of characters: 232):
[3] “I will perfectionistically micromanage you to prevent you from betraying
or abandoning me”; [4] “I will rant and rave or leave at the first sign of a lonely feeling, because
‘if you really loved me, I would never feel lonely’”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1595 (Number of characters: 603):
The Critic: Subliminal B-Grade Movie Producer
The outer critic typically arises most powerfully during emotional flashbacks. At such times, it
transmutes unconscious abandonment pain into an overwhelmingly negative perception of
people and of life in general. It obsessively fantasizes, consciously and unconsciously, about how
people have or could hurt us. Over the years these fantasies typically expand from scary snapshots into film clips and
even movies. Without realizing it, we can amass a video collection of real and imagined
betrayals that destroy our capacity to be nurtured by human contact.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1596 (Number of characters: 478):
“Don’t trust anyone”, “Proud to be a loner”, “You can only depend on yourself”, “Lovers
always leave you”, “Kids will break your heart”, “Only fools let on what they really think”,
“Give them an inch and they’ll take a mile”, are titles of video themes survivors may develop in
their quest for interpersonal safety. These defensive and often subliminal daydreams are analogs of the critic-spawned
nightmares that also shore up the “safety” work of frightening us into isolation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1597 (Number of characters: 175):
Over time, with
enough recovery, intrusive anti-intimacy reveries become clues that we are actually in a
flashback, and that we need to invoke our flashback management skills.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1598 (Number of characters: 79):
The dynamics of the outer critic are often obscured by minimization and denial.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1599 (Number of characters: 80):
Its obsessions
and “daymares” often occur just below the level of our awareness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1600 (Number of characters: 567):
They become subliminal via
their repetitiveness like the sound of waves at the beach - like the sounds of traffic in the city -
like the sound of the critic repetitively calling you or someone else a jerk, a loser, a dumbsh*t! Watching The News As A Trigger
Sometimes the outer critic’s penchant for raising false alarms ensnares us with an insatiable
hunger for listening to the news. When we do not resist this junk food feeding of our psyches
with a news “service” that exults so thoroughly in the negative, we can be left floundering in a
dreadful hypervigilance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1601 (Number of characters: 102):
The critic can then work overtime to amass irrefutable proof that the world is unforgivably
dangerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1602 (Number of characters: 80):
Isolation, and minimal or superficial relating, is therefore, our only recourse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1603 (Number of characters: 447):
At such
times any inclination to call a friend triggers images of rejection and humiliation before the
phone can even be picked up. When flashbacks are particularly intense, impulses to venture out
may immediately trigger fantasies of being verbally harassed or even mugged on the street. In worse case scenarios, outer critic drasticizing deteriorates into paranoia. At its worst
paranoia deteriorates into fantasies and delusions of persecution.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1604 (Number of characters: 131):
I remember one horribly,

humiliating experience that occurred in my early twenties on an occasion when I was very sleep-
deprived.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1605 (Number of characters: 82):
I was sitting on a park bench struggling to concentrate on the book I was reading.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1606 (Number of characters: 307):
I had
read the same short paragraph four times and barely registered a word of it. At the same time, I
was becoming more and more aware of a group of people who had sat down behind me. I started
feeling ashamed because they were having a great time while I sat there painfully self-conscious
and despondent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1607 (Number of characters: 61):
Suddenly I realized they were talking disparagingly about me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1608 (Number of characters: 32):
I was too scared to turn
around.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1609 (Number of characters: 46):
Their comments became steadily more insulting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1610 (Number of characters: 48):
Their loud laughter became
increasingly mocking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1611 (Number of characters: 12):
In my mind’s

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1612 (Number of characters: 5):
I eye

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1613 (Number of characters: 79):
I could see them all staring and pointing at me: “Look
at that sorry-ass loser.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1614 (Number of characters: 41):
He’s pretending he’s not even listening!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1615 (Number of characters: 82):
Finally, in desperation, I turned
around and croaked out a weak “What’s going on?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1616 (Number of characters: 196):
I was shocked and even more mortified at the same time. They were not even looking at
me. They were so immersed in their joyful banter that they did not even notice that I turned
around and spoke.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1617 (Number of characters: 85):
It became immediately obvious to me that it was a terrible figment of my
imagination.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1618 (Number of characters: 134):
I slunk away in shame and had to wait decades to understand how my Cptsd and the
outer critic had manufactured this terrible paranoia.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1619 (Number of characters: 29):
INTIMACY AND THE OUTER CRITIC

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1620 (Number of characters: 532):
As stated earlier, Cptsd typically includes an attachment disorder that comes from the absence of
a sympathetic caregiver in childhood. When the developing child lacks a supportive parental
refuge, she never learns that other people can soothe loneliness and emotional pain. She never
learns that real intimacy grows out of sharing all of her experience. To the degree that our caretakers attack or abandon us for showing vulnerability, to that
degree do we later avoid the authentic self-expression that is fundamental to intimacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1621 (Number of characters: 105):
The outer
critic forms to remind us that everyone else is surely as dangerous as our original caretakers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1622 (Number of characters: 145):
Subliminal memories of being scorned for seeking our parents’ support then short-circuit our
inclinations to share our troubles and ask for help.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1623 (Number of characters: 120):
Even worse, retaliation fantasies can plague us for hours and days on the occasions when
we do show our vulnerabilities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1624 (Number of characters: 613):
I once experienced this after being very honest and vulnerable in
a job interview with a committee of eight. Over the next three insomnia-plagued nights, my outer
critic ran non-stop films featuring my interviewers’ contempt about everything I had said, and
disgust about all that I had left out. Even after they subsequently and enthusiastically hired me,
the outer critic plagued me with “imposter syndrome” fantasies of eventually being exposed as
incompetent in the new job. The No-Win Situation
While scaring us out of trusting others, the outer critic also pushes us to over-control them to
make them safer.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1625 (Number of characters: 123):
Over-controlling behaviors include shaming, excessive criticism, monologing
[conversational control] and overall bossiness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1626 (Number of characters: 97):
An extreme example of the latter is the no-win
situation, which is also known as the double bind.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1627 (Number of characters: 80):
It is described in the vernacular as “damned if
you do, and damned if you don’t.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1628 (Number of characters: 617):
”[Only the most severe fight types do this consciously. These
types are found on the end of the narcissistic continuum where narcissism turns into sociopathy.] Sterling was a fight type client of mine who was strongly narcissistic, but not sociopathic. He wanted me to prove that I was meticulously attending to his pause-less monologue by giving
him an empathic “un hunh” at about the rate of once a paragraph. He would usually cue me to do
this by ending a sentence with “You Know?”
Over time, I could usually tell when he was in a flashback because he would be bothered by
the frequency or quality of my “un hunh.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1629 (Number of characters: 71):
He was alternately frustrated if I used too many or too
few “un hunhs”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1630 (Number of characters: 82):
In the first instance he fumed: “Haven’t you ever heard of a rhetorical
question?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1631 (Number of characters: 128):
In the alternate instance, his frustration flared out at my lack of sympathy because I
was not responding with “un hunh” enough.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1632 (Number of characters: 57):
There is an inner critic version of the no-win situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1633 (Number of characters: 79):
Howard came into a session with a 102
temperature and a raging case of the flu.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1634 (Number of characters: 113):
He told me: “I was lying in bed fluctuating between the
sweats and the chills, and the critic was kicking my ass.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1635 (Number of characters: 32):
‘You lazy, flakey piece of sh*t!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1636 (Number of characters: 32):
Stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1637 (Number of characters: 53):
Get off your sorry ass and get to your appointment!’”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1638 (Number of characters: 106):
Howard then told me that he fought this for about fifteen minutes, but the critic finally won
and he came.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1639 (Number of characters: 82):
As he sat in my waiting room, the critic started in again: “You are such an idiot.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1640 (Number of characters: 55):
How could you be so stupid to go out feeling like this?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1641 (Number of characters: 59):
You masochistic loser, you’re just trying
to kill yourself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1642 (Number of characters: 196):
Why do you even bother trying to get better?”
Scaring Others Away
To avoid the vulnerability of being close, the outer critic can also broadcast from the various
inner critic endangerment program.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1643 (Number of characters: 116):
Catastrophizing out loud can be very triggering to others and
can be an unconscious way of making them afraid of us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1644 (Number of characters: 109):
One of my basketball-playing acquaintances is addicted to listening to a local, doom-and-
gloom news station.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1645 (Number of characters: 120):
He has managed to alienate everyone in our gym by his non-stop
proselytizing about the catastrophic demise of our times.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1646 (Number of characters: 155):
One of the players joked that he will
not pass him the ball anymore because he thinks the guy believes that it is impossible for it to go
through the hoop.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1647 (Number of characters: 555):
Survivors who unnecessarily frighten others by excessively broadcasting about all the
possible things that could go wrong rarely endear themselves to others. Moreover, they “force”
others to avoid and abandon them when their negative noticing reaches a critical mass and
becomes noise pollution. VACILLATING BETWEEN OUTER AND INNER CRITIC
Many Cptsd survivors flounder in caustic judgmentalness, shuffling back and forth between
pathologizing others [the toxic blame of the outer critic] and pathologizing themselves [the toxic
shame of the inner critic].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1648 (Number of characters: 107):
They get stuck in endless loops of detailing the relational inadequacies
of others, and then of themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1649 (Number of characters: 110):
My parents’ twisted version of this boiled down to: “As f*cked up as we are, we’re still way
better than you”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1650 (Number of characters: 136):
Karen Horney described this trauma two-step as all-or-none lurching between

the polarities of the grandiose self and the despised self.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1651 (Number of characters: 238):
When we become lost in this process, we miss out on our crucial emotional need to
experience a sense of belonging. We live in permanent estrangement oscillating between the
extremes of too good for others or too unlikeable to be included.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1652 (Number of characters: 142):
This is the excruciating social
perfectionism of the Janus-faced critic: others are too flawed to love and we are too defective to
be lovable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1653 (Number of characters: 70):
A verbal diagram of a typical critic-looping scenario looks like this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1654 (Number of characters: 126):
The outer critic’s
judgmentalness is activated by the need to escape the “in-danger” feeling that is triggered by
socializing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1655 (Number of characters: 105):
Even the thought of relating can set off our disapproval programs so that we feel
justified in isolating.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1656 (Number of characters: 89):
Extended withdrawal however, reawakens our relational hunger and our
impulses to connect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1657 (Number of characters: 174):
This simultaneously reverses the critic from outer to inner mode. The critic
then laundry lists our inadequacies, convincing us that we are too odious to others to socialize.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1658 (Number of characters: 168):
This then generates self-pitying persecution fantasies, which eventually re-invites the outer critic
to build a case about how awful people are…ad infinitum…ad nauseam.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1659 (Number of characters: 72):
This looping then keeps
us “safe” in the hiding of silent disengagement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1660 (Number of characters: 493):
When it emanates from the inner critic direction, the vacillating critic can look like this. The
survivor’s negative self-noticing drives her to strive to be perfect. She works so hard and
incessantly at it that she begins to resent others who do not. Once the resentment accumulates
enough, a minor faux pas in another triggers her to shift into extreme outer critic disappointment
and frustration. She then silently perseverates and laundry lists “people” for all their faults and
betrayals.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1661 (Number of characters: 231):
How long she remains polarized to the outer critic usually depends on her 4F type, but
sooner or later she starts to feel guilty about this, and suddenly the inner critic is back on line
judging her harshly for being so judgmental.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1662 (Number of characters: 59):
The cataloguing of her own defects then resumes in
earnest.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1663 (Number of characters: 104):
A Case Example Of The Vacillating Critic
My wife and I have been living together for more than a decade.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1664 (Number of characters: 199):
We have come a long way in
negotiating what seems to both of us - most of the time – a fair and flexible approach to handling
the innumerable tasks involved in running a household with a young child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1665 (Number of characters: 128):
But sometimes, when
I am experiencing an extended flashback, I start over-noticing imperfections in the general
household order.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1666 (Number of characters: 398):
Where the critic first points the finger varies. If I am triggered into tired survival mode, the
inner critic can launch into berating me for my sub-standard contribution. If on the other hand I
am triggered into flight mode and have been speed-cleaning, my outer critic can start keeping
score. In this latter mode, my outer critic can perseverate about how little my wife is doing
compared to me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1667 (Number of characters: 89):
The comparisons are typically in the areas where I have recently been over-
contributing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1668 (Number of characters: 132):
But my fawn side is pretty strong and before too long, I can start noticing all the venues
where I do not contribute as much as she.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1669 (Number of characters: 52):
And suddenly I am the selfish slacker of the family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1670 (Number of characters: 96):
As
the flashback continues, I may then flip into berating myself for being picky and ungenerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1671 (Number of characters: 224):
In an especially strong flash back, the outer critic will come back sooner or later and start
assigning more weight and importance to my contributions, and then belittle her for being, slack,
thoughtless, self-involved, etc.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1672 (Number of characters: 146):
In our early relationship I could loop this loop for quite some time, losing hours even days
to feeling disaffected from my wife, and from myself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1673 (Number of characters: 145):
My peace of mind would deteriorate into
an inner battleground of feeling abandoned by her while simultaneously judging myself for
abandoning her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1674 (Number of characters: 105):
In the worst flashbacks, the process did not stay internal, and we would have
conflicts about this issue.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1675 (Number of characters: 46):
These days conflict rarely occurs over chores.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1676 (Number of characters: 115):
Because of what I have learned about the
outer critic, internal looping about this has also decreased immeasurably.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1677 (Number of characters: 154):
Mindfulness about my
outer and inner critic processes allows me to identify them sooner and rescue myself and my
relationship from them much more quickly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1678 (Number of characters: 88):
The scenario above is also a typical example of what worrying looks like in a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1679 (Number of characters: 100):
THE CRITIC AS JUDGE, JURY AND EXECUTIONER
As noted above, not all survivors hide their outer critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1680 (Number of characters: 100):
Fight types and subtypes can take the
passive out of passive-aggressive and become quite aggressive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1681 (Number of characters: 304):
The survivor who is polarized to
the outer critic often develops a specious belief that his subjectively derived standards of
correctness are objective truth. When triggered, he can use the critic’s combined detective-
lawyer-judge function to prosecute the other for betrayal with little or no evidence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1682 (Number of characters: 309):
Imagined
slights, insignificant peccadilloes, misread facial expressions, and inaccurate “psychic”
perceptions can be used to put relationships on trial. In the proceedings, the outer critic typically
refuses to admit positive evidence. Extenuating circumstances will not be considered in this
kangaroo court.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1683 (Number of characters: 121):
Moreover any relational disappointment can render a guilty verdict that
sentences the relationship to capital punishment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1684 (Number of characters: 182):
This is also the process by which jealousy can
become toxic and run riot. On another level, the outer critic is skilled at building a case to justify occupying a higher
moral ground.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1685 (Number of characters: 81):
From this lofty position, the critic then claims the right to micromanage others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1686 (Number of characters: 65):
Typically this is rationalized as being for the other’s own good.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1687 (Number of characters: 146):
This control, however, is usually
wielded on an unconscious level to protect the survivor from any reenactment of early parental
abuse or neglect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1688 (Number of characters: 77):
Micromanagement of others also devolves into a host of controlling behaviors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1689 (Number of characters: 220):
Fight types
treat others like captive audiences, give them unsolicited performance evaluations, make
unreasonable demands for improvement, and control their time schedules, social calendars and
food and clothing choices.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1690 (Number of characters: 483):
In worse case scenarios, they dramatically act out their jealousy, often
without cause. At its absolute worst, outer critic relating looks like taking prisoners, not making
friends. Scapegoating
Scapegoating is an outer critic process whereby personal frustration is unfairly dumped onto
others. Scapegoating is typically fuelled by unworked through anger about childhood
abandonment. Displacing anger on the wrong target however, fails to release or resolve old or

unrelated hurts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1691 (Number of characters: 261):
Scapegoating is often a reenactment of a parent’s abusive role. It is blind imitation of a
parent who habitually released his frustration by indiscriminately raging. When a fight type
parent scapegoats those around him, he enforces a perverse kind of mirroring.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1692 (Number of characters: 64):
He is making sure
that when he feels bad, so does everyone else.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1693 (Number of characters: 88):
It is like a bumper sticker I saw the other day: “If
Momma ain’t happy, Nobody’s happy.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1694 (Number of characters: 78):
I witnessed this common example of scapegoating several times in my childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1695 (Number of characters: 37):
My
parents hated anyone who was late.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1696 (Number of characters: 142):
If one of us children were even a minute late for something,
they felt absolutely justified in blasting us with their “righteous” indignation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1697 (Number of characters: 76):
This was true even
though we all learned very quickly to be anally punctual.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1698 (Number of characters: 139):
Because of their untreated Cptsd
however, their anger was the tip of the iceberg of their unexpressed rage about their own
childhood hurts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1699 (Number of characters: 259):
In this case, they were flashing back to the pain of their parents’ chronic
lateness and failure to show up to meet their normal childhood needs.
MINDFULNESS AND SHRINKING THE OUTER CRITIC
Reducing outer critic reactivity requires a great deal of mindfulness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1700 (Number of characters: 173):
This is as essential for fight
types who act out aggressively, as it is for those trauma types who internally rant against the
entire human group known as “F*cking People!”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1701 (Number of characters: 684):
It is also of great importance for any survivor
who is locked into alienation because of the judgmentalness of his outer critic. Mindfulness, once again, is the process of becoming intricately aware of everything that is
going on inside us, especially thoughts, images, feelings and sensations. In terms of outer critic
work, it is essential that we become more mindful of both the cognitive and emotional content of
our thoughts. This is the same as in inner critic work, where the two key fronts of critic shrinking are
cognitive and emotional. Cognitive work in both cases involves the demolition and rebuilding
processes of thought-stopping and thought substitution, respectively.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1702 (Number of characters: 178):
And, emotional work in
both instances is grief work. It is removing the critic’s fuel supply - the unexpressed childhood
anger and the uncried tears of a lifetime of abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1703 (Number of characters: 160):
When Mindfulness Appears To Intensify The Critic
In early recovery the outer critic unfortunately seems to become nastier and stronger the more we
challenge it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1704 (Number of characters: 532):
We may even think we are counter-productively stirring it up or making it worse by
daring to resist it. When mindfulness of the critic seems to strengthen it, we are typically flashing back to how
our parents rebuked our early protests at their attacks. This is often impossible to remember
because our dysfunctional parents typically kill our protest function before our memory function
comes on line. Nonetheless, fear of parental reprisal is often the unconscious dynamic that scares
us out of challenging our own toxic thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1705 (Number of characters: 462):
This is why survivors in early recovery often need
to invoke the instinct of angry self-protection to empower their thought-stopping. There is another dynamic occurring when critic-work seems to strengthen rather than
weaken the critic. As we become less dissociated, we begin to notice critic processes that were
there all along under the horizon of our awareness. Our childhood survival was aided by learning

to dissociate from these painful critic processes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1706 (Number of characters: 82):
Consequently, many of us come into recovery
barely able to even notice the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1707 (Number of characters: 86):
Our recovering depends on us using mindfulness to decrease our habits of dissociation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1708 (Number of characters: 343):
Only then can we see the critic programs that we need to deconstruct, shrink and consciously
disidentify from. This typically involves learning to tolerate the pain that comes from
discovering how pervasive and strong the critic is. This pain is sometimes a hard pill to swallow
because progress in fighting the critic is hard to see at first.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1709 (Number of characters: 109):
And then, even when our shrinking
work is effective, progress usually feels disappointingly slow and gradual.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1710 (Number of characters: 93):
This is especially true
during a flashback, when the critic can seem to be as strong as ever.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1711 (Number of characters: 65):
As stated earlier, the critic grew carcinogenically in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1712 (Number of characters: 84):
It is like a pervasive cancer
that requires many uncomfortable operations to remove.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1713 (Number of characters: 166):
Nonetheless, we can choose to face the
acute pain of critic-shrinking work because we want to end the chronic pain of having the critic
destroy our enjoyment of life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1714 (Number of characters: 461):
It is the fight of a lifetime. Thought Substitution And Correction: Supplanting the Critic
Many of us are still developmentally arrested in our need to orient our psyches towards noticing
what is good, trustworthy and loveable about others and life in general. In working to shrink the
outer critic, thought substitution is the practice of invoking positive thoughts and images of
others to help erode the critic’s intimacy-spoiling habit of picking them apart.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1715 (Number of characters: 152):
One helpful thought substitution exercise is to list five recollections of positive interactions
with a given friend, as well as five of her attributes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1716 (Number of characters: 117):
This same technique works well when we
self-apply it to help us separate from our inner critic’s negative self-image.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1717 (Number of characters: 124):
Toolbox 5, in chapter
16, contains a written exercise to broaden your appreciation of select others who have benefitted
you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1718 (Number of characters: 159):
Since thoughts typically give rise to speech, I also recommend that you practice the “5
positives to 1 negative” guideline when giving feedback to a loved one.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1719 (Number of characters: 115):
John Gottman’s research
has shown that this ratio is characteristic of how intimacy-successful couples communicate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1720 (Number of characters: 561):
This
is also key because the outer critic was spawned in childhood by parental modeling that at least
reversed this ratio. GRIEVING SHORTCIRCUITS THE OUTER CRITIC
The role of grieving in shrinking the outer critic is as crucial as it is with the inner critic. As with
the inner critic, angering at the outer critic helps to silence it, and crying helps to evaporate it. We can use the anger of our grief to energize our thought corrections. This helps us to
challenge the critic’s entrenched all-or-none perspective that everyone is as dangerous as our
parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1721 (Number of characters: 230):
Moreover, when our grieving opens into crying, it can release the fear that the outer
critic uses to frighten us out of opening to others. Tears can also help us realize that our
loneliness is now causing us much unnecessary pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1722 (Number of characters: 84):
This in turn can motivate us to open to the
possibility of finding safe connections.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1723 (Number of characters: 525):
Defueling The Outer Critic Via Working The Transference

Transference [AKA projection; AKA displacement] occurs when unprocessed feelings from the
past amplify present time feelings. A key characteristic of outer critic-dominated flashbacks is
that we displace emotional pain from past relationships onto current ones. Transference is the
pipeline from the past that supplies the critic with anger to control, attack or disapprove of
present relationships. As a baby thrives on love, so does the outer critic thrive on anger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1724 (Number of characters: 612):
Like a parasite, the outer
critic gorges on repressed anger, and then erroneously assigns it to present-day disappointments. The most common transferrential dynamic that I witness occurs when leftover hurt about a
parent gets displaced onto someone we perceive as hurting us in the present. When this occurs,
we respond to them with a magnified anger or anguish that is out of proportion to what they did. Transference can also grossly distort our perceptions, and sometimes we can misperceive a
harmless person as being hurtful. Transference can fire up the critic to imagine slights that do not
actually occur.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1725 (Number of characters: 579):
Transference typically runs wild when the outer critic is on a rampage. Just as the inner critic transmutes unreleased anger into self-hate, the outer critic uses it to
control and /or push others away. Unexpressed and unworked through anger about childhood
hurt is a hidden reserve that the critic can always tap into. The anger work of grieving the losses
of childhood is so essential because it breaks the critic’s supply line to this anger. Grieving out old unexpressed pain about our poor parenting gradually deconstructs the
process of transferring it unfairly onto others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1726 (Number of characters: 303):
This is crucial because love and intimacy are
murdered when the critic habitually projects old anger out at an intimate. Healthy Outer Critic Venting
There are times when venting from the outer critic perspective is healthy, self-protective
behavior. Sometimes the outer critic’s judgments are accurate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1727 (Number of characters: 73):
Sometimes people are acting as
abusively as our parents did in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1728 (Number of characters: 80):
In this vein, there are two healthy applications of outer
critic aggressiveness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1729 (Number of characters: 66):
One is to protect ourselves when someone is actually attacking us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1730 (Number of characters: 197):
The
other is in the work of grieving the losses of childhood. As we shall see in the next chapter,
survivors benefit immeasurably from angrily judging their parents’ atrocious abuse and
negligence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1731 (Number of characters: 287):
Road Rage, Transference And The Outer Critic
Let us take another look at how the outer critic displaces anger from the past onto present-day
relationships. My client Johnny came in for his session boiling with road rage. Something infuriating had
just occurred on his drive to my office.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1732 (Number of characters: 67):
Before his butt hit the couch, he launched away: “That
pompous SOB!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1733 (Number of characters: 24):
People are so obnoxious.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1734 (Number of characters: 56):
Everyone drives like they are the only ones on the road.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1735 (Number of characters: 12):
What a jerk.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1736 (Number of characters: 81):
Driving like he owns the whole road. Not giving a sh*t about anybody but himself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1737 (Number of characters: 42):
Nobody cares about anybody but themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1738 (Number of characters: 7):
Oh god!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1739 (Number of characters: 36):
Don’t let me get started on my wife.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1740 (Number of characters: 49):
I
don’t know why I get out of bed in the morning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1741 (Number of characters: 56):
This jerk must have forgotten what turn signals
are for.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1742 (Number of characters: 80):
I felt like crashing right into that stuck-up bastard and his shiny new Beamer!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1743 (Number of characters: 41):
Johnny radiated anger a full 360 degrees.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1744 (Number of characters: 305):
He hated the driver who had cut him off, all the
other drivers on the road, his wife, his employees, his neighbors, the government, and last - but

thankfully least - his “overcharging therapist” who was always pretending to be “soooo
empathetic.” Johnny was a fawn-fight type. Usually he was mostly fawn.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1745 (Number of characters: 99):
In our two years of working
together, I had never seen him so enraged, and I was quite taken aback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1746 (Number of characters: 86):
I was indeed straining to
hold an empathic position, but I knew he was in a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1747 (Number of characters: 78):
I encouraged him to further ventilate by hitting a tennis racket on a cushion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1748 (Number of characters: 94):
[This is a
classic anger-release work technique for externalizing anger in a non-harmful way].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1749 (Number of characters: 44):
Johnny beat
it like his life depended on it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1750 (Number of characters: 63):
When his catharting petered out, I asked him to close his eyes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1751 (Number of characters: 90):
I then suggested that he ask
himself if his feelings of outrage had a trail into the past.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1752 (Number of characters: 36):
After a moment he said: “I’m so mad.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1753 (Number of characters: 51):
I
don’t want to do anything that you say right now.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1754 (Number of characters: 93):
And it’s weird because I know you’re fishing
for my father, but I keep thinking of my mother.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1755 (Number of characters: 258):
She was such a wimp! She’d never drive like
that asshole in the Beamer, and she didn’t rant and rave at me like he did, but you know I just
feel so pissed at her for putting up with him for all those years, and never once standing up for
me or protecting me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1756 (Number of characters: 84):
It’s bad enough I got him for father, but it’s even more unfair that I got her
too”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1757 (Number of characters: 122):
Johnny did another round of venting with the tennis racket: “I thought mothers were
programmed to stick up for their kids!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1758 (Number of characters: 37):
You know, like that mother bear sh*t.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1759 (Number of characters: 51):
It’s so unfair…it’s
so un-f*cken-believably unfair.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1760 (Number of characters: 107):
I’d just like to shake her out of that numb trance she’d go into. Just shake some freaking sense into her!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1761 (Number of characters: 24):
And then the tears came.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1762 (Number of characters: 50):
Shortly after they subsided, the epiphany arrived.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1763 (Number of characters: 18):
It made him
laugh.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1764 (Number of characters: 10):
Genuinely.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1765 (Number of characters: 116):
It was the laughter of relief that we sometimes get when we finally understand
why something is really bothering us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1766 (Number of characters: 157):
He said: “You know this sounds pretty far-fetched and like
that psychobabble I hate, but it’s the goddamn unfairness of life that just pisses me off so much.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1767 (Number of characters: 135):
You know that you-got-the-queen-of-spades bad luck. That bad luck of being the one person in
the crowd who gets crapped on by a pigeon.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1768 (Number of characters: 147):
That cursed luck of getting dealt those assholes from
the parenting deck. It’s so goddamned unfair! Dad and mom’s unfairness was f*cking legendary!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1769 (Number of characters: 84):
“And that jerk on the freeway making a lane change without signaling was unfair too.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1770 (Number of characters: 73):
I
mean if I hadn’t seen him, I could have gotten into a serious accident.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1771 (Number of characters: 49):
But if I’m honest, it wasn’t
really all that bad.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1772 (Number of characters: 86):
I had plenty of time to adjust, and would have been a lousy driver myself if I
hadn’t.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1773 (Number of characters: 43):
“But, I mean it was still dangerous though.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1774 (Number of characters: 49):
But nothing compared to growing up in that
house.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1775 (Number of characters: 607):
Now that was pure, unadulterated danger for you. I guess my rage was mostly about how
unfair it was that I had to grow up in that sorry excuse for a home.”
Road rage and the less intense irritations we experience with our fellow drivers are common
forms of outer critic transference. When we become more mindful of our driving frustrations or
other minor everyday annoyances, we can look below the tip of this iceberg for old unexpressed
anger and hurt that it reminds us of. I encourage you to experiment with this next time you are inordinately angry at some driver
for a relatively minor driving mistake.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1776 (Number of characters: 599):
You can try asking yourself: “What is this situation or
feeling reminding me of?” In the next chapter, we will explore more deeply the processes of

grieving through the old hurts that we discover when we get to the bottom of our flashbacks. GRIEVING
Grieving is an irreplaceable tool for resolving the overwhelming feelings that arise during
emotional flashbacks. Moreover, grieving is the key process for working through the host of
losses that come from growing up in a Cptsd-inducing family. We grieve the losses of childhood because these losses are like deaths of important parts of
ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1777 (Number of characters: 389):
Effective grieving brings these parts back to life. In this chapter we describe the
healing that is available through the four practices of grieving: angering, crying, verbal
ventilating and feeling. If you find that crying or angering is inaccessible, does not help, or makes you feel worse, then
your recovery work my need to focus more on deconstructing and shrinking your inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1778 (Number of characters: 246):
Grieving expands Insight and Understanding
I saw grief drinking a cup of sorrow and called out:
“It tastes sweet doesn’t it?”
“You have caught me”, grief answered,
“And you’ve ruined my business
How can I sell sorrow, when you know its blessing?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1779 (Number of characters: 5):
-RUMI

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1780 (Number of characters: 100):
Insight, as crucially important as it is, is never enough to attain the deeper levels of recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1781 (Number of characters: 139):
No amount of intention or epiphany can bypass a survivor’s need to learn to lovingly care for
himself when he is in an emotional flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1782 (Number of characters: 570):
It is crucial that we respond to ourselves with
kindness when we are feeling scared, sad, mad, or bad. Grieving aids the survivor immeasurably to work through the death-like experience of being

lost and trapped in an emotional flashback. Grieving metabolizes our most painful abandonment
feelings, especially those that give rise to suicidal ideation, and at their worst, active suicidality. Recoverees also need to grieve the death of their early attachment needs. We must grieve
the awful fact that safety and belonging was scarce or non-existent in our own families.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1783 (Number of characters: 706):
We need
to mourn the myriad heartbreaks of our frustrated attempts to win approval and affection from
our parents. Grieving also supports recovery from the many painful, deathlike losses caused by
childhood traumatization. Key childhood losses - addressed throughout this book - are all the
crucial developmental arrests that we suffered. The most essential of these are the deaths of our
self-compassion and our self-esteem, as well as our abilities to protect ourselves and fully
express ourselves. Grieving The Absence Of Parental Care
As our capacity to grieve evolves, we typically uncover a great deal of unresolved grief about the
deadening absence of the nurturance we needed to develop and thrive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1784 (Number of characters: 89):
Here are the key types of
parental nurturing that all children need in order to flourish.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1785 (Number of characters: 140):

can help you to grieve out the unreleased pain that comes from having grown up without this
type of support.

identifying and grieving the losses of childhood. Sandra Bloom’s article: “The Grief That Dare
Not Speak Its Name, Part II, Dealing with The Ravages of Childhood” also identifies childhood
losses from trauma in a very specific and compelling way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1804 (Number of characters: 320):
[Please see www.sanctuaryweb.com]. It is often difficult to become motivated to grieve losses that occurred so long ago. Many of these
losses seem so nebulous that trying to embrace grieving is a bit like trying to embrace dental
work. Who wants to go to the dentist? But who doesn’t go once the toothache becomes acute?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1805 (Number of characters: 818):
Soul ache is considerably harder to assign to the losses of childhood, yet those who take the
grieving journey described below come to know unquestionably that the core of their soul ache
and psychological suffering is in the unworked through losses of growing up with abandoning
parents. These losses have to be grieved until the person really gets how much her caretakers were
not caretakers, and how much her parents were not her allies. She needs to grieve until she stops
blaming herself for their abuse and/or neglect. She needs to grieve until she fully realizes that
their abysmal parenting practices gave her that awful gift that keeps on giving: Cptsd. She needs
to grieve until she understands how her learned habit of automatic self-abandonment is a
reenactment of their abject failure to be there for her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1806 (Number of characters: 649):
Mourning these awful realities empowers our efforts to develop a multidimensional practice
of self-care. As we grieve more effectively, our capacities for self-compassion and self-
protection grow, and our psyche becomes increasingly user friendly. GRIEVING AMELIORATES FLASHBACKS
“Pain is excess energy crying out for release.” – Gerald Heard
Grieving sometimes seems sacramental to me in its ability to move me out of the abandonment
mélange, that extremely painful and upsetting amalgam of fear, shame and depression that is at
the emotional core of most flashbacks. A survivor can learn to grieve himself out of fear - the death of feeling safe.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1807 (Number of characters: 385):
He can learn to
grieve himself out of shame - the death of feeling worthy. He can learn to grieve himself out of
depression - the death of feeling fully alive. With sufficient grieving, the survivor gets that he was innocent and eminently loveable as a
child. As he mourns the bad luck of not being born to loving parents, he finds within himself a
fierce, unshakeable self-allegiance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1808 (Number of characters: 120):
He becomes ready, willing and able to be there for himself no
matter what he is experiencing - internally or externally.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1809 (Number of characters: 246):
Griefwork also releases you from the impatience and frustration that can arise when you get re-
stuck in an inner critic attack. This is especially important during those “monster” flashbacks
when the critic can bully you into wanting to give up.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1810 (Number of characters: 641):
At such times, angering and crying at this
terrible intrusion from your past can rescue you from forgetting how far you have come and how
much safer you are now. Inner Critic Hindrances To Grieving

The greatest hindrance to effective grieving is typically the inner critic. When the critic is
especially toxic, grieving may be counterproductive and contraindicated in early recovery. Those
who were repeatedly pathologized and punished for emoting in childhood may experience
grieving as exacerbating their flashbacks rather than relieving them. I have worked with numerous survivors whose tears immediately triggered them into toxic
shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1811 (Number of characters: 86):
Their own potentially soothing tears elicited terrible self-attacks: “I’m so pathetic!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1812 (Number of characters: 390):
No
wonder nobody can stand me!” “God, I’m so unlovable when I snivel like this!” “I f*ck up, and
then make myself more of a loser by whining about it!” “What good is crying for yourself – it
only makes you weaker!” This latter response is particularly ironic, for once grieving is protected from the critic,
nothing can restore a person’s inner strength and coping capacity like a good cry.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1813 (Number of characters: 386):
I have defused
active suicidality on dozens of occasions by simply eliciting the suffering person’s tears. Angering can also immediately trigger the survivor into toxic shame. This is often true of
instances when there is only an angry thought or fantasy. Dysfunctional parents typically reserve
their worst punishments for their child’s anger. This then traps the child’s anger inside.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1814 (Number of characters: 603):
Critic management is often the primary work of early stage grief work. This work involves
recognizing and challenging the ways the critic is blocking or shaming the processes of grieving. As disidentification from the critic increases, grieving can then best be initiated with low
intensity verbal ventilation. Over time verbal ventilation can be allowed to gradually increase in
sad and angry intonation. Once the critic has been sufficiently diminished and once thought-correction techniques
have made the psyche more user-friendly, a person begins to tap into grief’s sweet relief-granting
potential.

He learns to grieve in a way that promotes and enhances compassion for the abandoned
child he was and for the survivor he is today – still struggling in the throes of painful flashbacks. Defueling The Critic Through Grieving
Fear drives the toxic inner critic. The critic feeds off fear and flashes the survivor back to the
frightening times of childhood. She gets stuck seeing herself only through her parents’
contemptuous, intimidating or rejecting eyes. She then imitates them and scornfully mocks
herself as “defective”, “ugly”, “unlovable”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1816 (Number of characters: 580):
She scares herself with endangerment scenarios and
abhors herself for insignificant imperfections. Because fear is a core emotional experience, emotional tools are needed to manage the
fright that runs haywire during a flashback. Healthy angering and crying can short-circuit fear
from morphing into the flashback-triggering cognitions of the critic. I have seen grieving bring
the critic’s devastating programs of drasticizing and catastrophizing to a screeching halt on
thousands of occasions. It appears that children are hard-wired to release fear through angering and crying.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1817 (Number of characters: 600):
The
newborn baby, mourning the death of living safely and fully contained inside the mother, utters
the first of many angry cries not only to call for nurturance and attention, but also to release her
fear. In the dysfunctional family however, the traumatizing parent soon eradicates the child’s
capacity to emote. The child becomes afraid and ashamed of her own tears and anger. Tears get
shut off and anger gets trapped inside and is eventually turned against the self as self-attack, self-
hate, self-disgust, and self-rejection. Self-hate is the most grievous reenactment of parental
abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1818 (Number of characters: 478):
Over time, anger also becomes fuel for the critic and actually exacerbates fear by creating
an increasingly dangerous internal environment. Anything the survivor says, thinks, feels,
imagines or wishes for is subjected to an intimidating inner attack. Here are some common anger-powered critic attacks. They are presented in the first person
voice, which the critic inevitably acquires: “Why did I ask such a stupid question?” “Could I
have had an uglier expression on my face?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1819 (Number of characters: 18):
“Who am I kidding?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1820 (Number of characters: 54):
How could an undeserving
loser like me wish for love?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1821 (Number of characters: 429):
“No wonder I feel like sh*t; I am a piece of sh*t!” Recovery is enhanced immeasurably by co-opting this anger from the critic and using it for
the work of distancing from and shrinking the critic, as we shall see below. As you become
proficient at grieving, you will notice that your critic’s volume and intensity ebbs dramatically. In fact, without the aid of effective grieving, progress in critic shrinking can only go so far.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1822 (Number of characters: 157):
THE FOUR PROCESSES OF GRIEVING
Grieving is at its most effective when the survivor can grieve in four ways: angering, crying,
verbal ventilating and feeling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1823 (Number of characters: 2):
1.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1824 (Number of characters: 589):
Angering: Diminishes Fear and Shame
Angering is the grieving technique of aggressively complaining about current or past losses and
injustices. Survivors need to anger - sometimes rage - about the intimidation, humiliation and
neglect that was passed off to them as nurturance in their childhoods. As they become adept at
grieving, they anger out their healthy resentment at their family’s pervasive lack of safety. They
become incensed about the ten thousand betrayals of never being helped in times of need. They
feel rage that there was never anyone to go to for guidance or protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1825 (Number of characters: 124):
They bellow that there
was no one to appeal to for fairness or appreciative recognition of their developmental
achievements.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1826 (Number of characters: 208):
My first book, The Tao of Fully Feeling, Harvesting Forgiveness Out Of Blame, explicates
in great detail a safe process for angering out childhood pain in a way that does not hurt the
survivor or anyone else.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1827 (Number of characters: 89):
In most cases, survivors do not have to directly anger at and blame their
living parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1828 (Number of characters: 86):
The key place to direct it is at your internalized parents - the parents of your past.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1829 (Number of characters: 72):
The most common exception to this occurs when a parent is still abusive.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1830 (Number of characters: 65):
This and other
exceptions are explored in depth in my first book.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1831 (Number of characters: 561):
Angering is therapeutic when the survivor rails against childhood trauma, and especially
when he rails against its living continuance in the self-hate processes of the critic. Angrily saying
“No!” or “Shut Up!” to the critic, the deputy of his parents, externalizes his anger. It stops him
from turning this anger against himself, and allows him to revive the lost instinct of defending
himself against unjust attack. Additionally, angering rescues the survivor from toxic shame. It rescues him from blindly

letting his parents’ venomous blame turn into shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1832 (Number of characters: 50):
Angering redirects blame back to where it
belongs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1833 (Number of characters: 493):
It also augments his motivation to keep fighting to establish internal boundaries against
the critic. Angering can be done alone or in the presence of a validating witness, such as a trusted
friend or therapist. Over time the vast majority of angering needs to be done silently in the
privacy of your own psyche. This is the anger-empowered thought-stopping of shielding yourself
from inner critic attacks. Many survivors are so identified with the critic that it becomes their whole identity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1834 (Number of characters: 336):
Such
survivors typically need to focus on fighting off the critic until they have established the healthy
ego function of self-protection. Angering also serves to rescue a person from the childlike sense of powerlessness that she
is flashing back to. It reminds her that she inhabits an adult body with which she can now defend
herself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1835 (Number of characters: 271):
Through all these functions, angering serves to reduce or antidote fear. It reawakens and
nurtures the instinct of self-preservation. With practice it increasingly builds a sense of both
outer and inner boundaries. These boundaries increasingly move us out of harm’s way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1836 (Number of characters: 845):
They
offer safety from the bullying of others, and safety from the most damaging bully of all – the
inner critic. Finally, angering can also empower the myriad thought corrections and substitutions needed
to establish the survivor’s belief in her own essential goodness and in the lovability of
discriminately chosen others. Angering bolsters her for the long-term, gradual process of
wrestling her self-image away from the critic and reeducating the psyche to make it both user-
and intimacy-friendly. Angering Helps Deconstruct Repetition Compulsion
Survivors need to resuscitate their instinctual anger about parental maltreatment or they risk
blindly accepting others’ reenactments of these behaviors. A meek, visibly fearful client of mine suffered devastating sexual seductions by trusted
male figures on three occasions in her adult life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1837 (Number of characters: 207):
Over time we traced these back to a childhood
betrayal by a trusted uncle, the only seemingly kind caretaker of her childhood. She was
emotionally abandoned by her parents, and he preyed upon her loneliness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1838 (Number of characters: 120):
He gradually took
appropriate physical affection, one increment at a time, into contact that became increasingly
sexual.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1839 (Number of characters: 132):
My client was helpless with her uncle because her ability to say “no” was parentally
extinguished by the time she was in pre-school.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1840 (Number of characters: 75):
The ability to say “no” is the backbone of our
instinct of self-protection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1841 (Number of characters: 62):
Consequently, she was unable to protest his sexual violations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1842 (Number of characters: 594):
On subsequent occasions in her life, a minister, a doctor and then a therapist exploited her
via a reenactment of this original scenario. She was so lost in flashback all three times that she
did not protest their exploitive betrayals. She could only react to the situations later by turning
her anger inward, and blaming and shaming herself for not stopping it. Eventually during our work together, she was able to engage in the angering process of
grieving. After about six months of my witnessing and validating her anger at her various
perpetrators, she came in one week glowing with pride.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1843 (Number of characters: 575):
She welled with tears of joy and relief as

she described her success in stopping an office predator who was in the early stages of a similar
seduction. This was the stage of seemingly friendly touching. But unwanted pats on the back gradually
escalated into mild sexual innuendo, lingering touches on her hand and then her forearm. These
were the first inappropriate advances that she had never been able to protest with her previous
abusers. She was thrilled – in awe of herself – that she was able to say, in the presence of another
worker no less: “Please don’t touch me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1844 (Number of characters: 77):
I don’t like it when you touch me, and I don’t want you
to touch me anymore”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1845 (Number of characters: 41):
The seduction was immediately terminated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1846 (Number of characters: 447):
2. Crying: The Penultimate Soothing
In grieving, crying is the yin complementary process to the yang process of angering. When we
are hurt, we instinctively feel sad as well as mad. The newborn child, hurt by the loss of the
perfect security of the womb, howls an angry cry. Crying is also an irreplaceable tool for cutting off the critic’s emotional fuel supply. Tears
can release fear before it devolves into frightened and frightening thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1847 (Number of characters: 306):
In fact, crying is
sometimes the only process that will resolve a flashback. I have witnessed my own critic wither
into innocuousness hundreds of times after a good cry. On thousands of other occasions, I have
seen my clients dissolve their fear, shame and self-abandonment with the solvent of their tears.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1848 (Number of characters: 141):
I
have also seen them then surface into a healthily angry place, determined to confront a current
unfairness that they now find unacceptable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1849 (Number of characters: 498):
A client who left a year-long therapy to move elsewhere recently wrote to me about an
experience that she had with crying. She was hospitalized with terrible stomach pain and soon
learned that she had cancer. She had wisely cut off contact with a toxic family, but was all alone
in her new living situation. She was beside herself with fear, and felt like she was on the verge of
a nervous breakdown. She wrote: “I know you think that all that talking you did to me about
crying didn’t get through.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1850 (Number of characters: 145):
So did I in fact, but at the moment I was feeling the most hopeless,
some of your words came back to me, and a rainstorm of tears fell out of me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1851 (Number of characters: 274):
It scared me at
first, but I soon started feeling this amazing sense of relief, and that I would be OK if I let them
operate on me. It’s now twelve months since then and many tears later [not to mention a bit of
barking at God] and I seem to be well and truly in the clear.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1852 (Number of characters: 48):
Here is another testimony to the power of tears.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1853 (Number of characters: 123):
It is excerpted from an e-mail of a male
client who wrote to me six months after we finished a year long course of therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1854 (Number of characters: 347):
“I think it’s
the tears..... crying so much of late.....you were right! It’s great; I love it, tears of sadness, tears at
the beauty in the world, tears of grief and loss, and tears of gratitude that my life is finally
becoming manageable and even intimate. I’ve cried more in the past couple of months than I
have done the past couple of decades.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1855 (Number of characters: 147):
I am actually opening up to life, it’s become less narrow,
it’s not just pain, shame, guilt.....there’s something else, something quite beautiful.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1856 (Number of characters: 128):
An additional benefit of crying is that unabashed tears stimulate the relaxation response of the
parasympathetic nervous system.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1857 (Number of characters: 612):
This counterbalances the excessive sympathetic nervous
system hyperarousal we experience in a flashback. As we learn to grieve effectively, we allow ourselves to mourn about the lack of positive
parental attention in our childhoods. We feel sorrow about the horrible reality that parental
attention was typically negative and dangerous. As recovering progresses, we also cry for the
child who not appreciated and reflected as special, worthy, and easy to love. Crying And Self-Compassion
When we greet our own tears with self-acceptance, crying awakens our develop- mentally
arrested instinct of self-compassion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1858 (Number of characters: 400):
Once we establish self-compassion through consistent and
repeated practice, it becomes the cornerstone of an increasing sense of self-esteem. When an
attitude of self-compassion becomes habitual, it can instantly antidote the self-abandonment that
so characterizes a flashback. Moreover self-compassion creates a foundation from which we can build authentic,
intimacy-enhancing compassion for others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1859 (Number of characters: 147):
The depth of our ability to be there for an intimate
generally depends on the depth of our capacity to practice unwavering allegiance to ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1860 (Number of characters: 133):
Crying And Angering In Concert
Crying and angering are the two key emotional tools for releasing the pain of the abandonment
mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1861 (Number of characters: 56):
Typically we need both processes to attain full release.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1862 (Number of characters: 406):
Crying and angering together differs from whining. Whining is a type of emoting that gives
grieving a bad name. Whining is a delicate subject because many people who complain and/or
cry in a healthy manner are pathologized as “whiners.” Dysfunctional whining however is often
an unhealthy mixture of angering and crying, where either the anger or sadness is repressed but
leaks through in a grating manner.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1863 (Number of characters: 623):
Here are two examples of this. When a hurt person only knows how to express anger, his
repressed sadness unconsciously seeps into his anger in a way that makes him sound like a
martyr or someone with delusions of persecution. Because there is no substantial release of his
sadness, no amount of whining brings him relief, and he can angrily whine endlessly in a way
that exhausts his listener’s empathy. Similarly when a hurt person is only able to cry, repressed
anger tinges her sadness and makes it sound like irritable and interminable bellyaching. One of
my clients calls this “anger coming through a very small hole.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1864 (Number of characters: 518):
Many of us suffer from a socialization process that relegates angering to men and crying to
women. From an early age boys are shamed for crying while girls are treated similarly for
angering. Hence boys become men who can only vent their emotional pain through angering. Sadness then must morph into an irritable mood, aggravated whining or angry catharsis. Similarly, some women unconsciously try to squeeze their anger out by whining or crying in a
way that devolves into feeling stuck in helplessness and self-pity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1865 (Number of characters: 131):
Many men also rely on anger to carry all of their emotional expression. They get mad when
they are scared, humiliated or feel down.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1866 (Number of characters: 70):
Many women, on the other hand, can only try to cry out
these feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1867 (Number of characters: 52):
This typically results in a very incomplete release.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1868 (Number of characters: 391):
The full motion of emotion is
arrested. Half of the normal emotional release process is then stymied in each gender. Without complete emoting of his hurt, a survivor can become stuck in moodiness. His
unexpressed emotion deteriorates into a stagnant and lingering mood. This moodiness can range

from festering resentment to a shame-tainted self-pity that is anything but self-compassionate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1869 (Number of characters: 122):
Blocked anger can degenerate into bitter sullenness, and blocked sadness can deteriorate into
melancholic self-indulgence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1870 (Number of characters: 141):
How this contrasts with the healthy grieving of my six-year old son, who has to periodically
grieve the loss of his narcissistic entitlement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1871 (Number of characters: 74):
Less and less does he get to be what Freud called:
“His majesty the baby”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1872 (Number of characters: 115):
As his previously apt entitlement lessens, he mildly bawls at new rules that are age-
appropriate for him to learn.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1873 (Number of characters: 92):
Bawling is the evolution of the baby’s angry cry, and it releases
pain through angry crying.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1874 (Number of characters: 127):
He howled a bit this afternoon about the “unfairness” of having to do
his homework after school before he could play some more.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1875 (Number of characters: 128):
As we climbed the 37 stairs to our home, he punctuated his crying with a flurry of angry
condemnations: “I don’t like you daddy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1876 (Number of characters: 16):
You’re not fair.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1877 (Number of characters: 33):
I’m not going to be your friend”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1878 (Number of characters: 182):
I am
grateful for this healthy grieving, and still somewhat amazed that I can so calmly “hold” it as I
help him metabolize this latest loss of early childhood narcissistic privilege.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1879 (Number of characters: 118):
By the time we get to the top of the stairs he opens the door and genuinely peals out a
guileless laugh: “Daddy, look!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1880 (Number of characters: 27):
Picachu fell off the table.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1881 (Number of characters: 213):
Daddy can we play Pokémon after I
practice writing my letters?”
Grieving has almost instantly delivered him from painful loss into eager apprehension of
what is fun about life and what there is to look forward to.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1882 (Number of characters: 309):
How frequently, I see my clients
reemerge into remembering their real, present-day resourcefulness once they have grieved
through a painful flashback. When we can both anger and cry while re-experiencing our early abandonment in a
flashback, we can obtain a more complete release from the abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1883 (Number of characters: 125):
Each survivor
does well to assess whether his angering or crying is blocked or stultified, and to then work at
recovering it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1884 (Number of characters: 111):
There are of course numerous men and women who are reverse examples of the gender
polarization mentioned above.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1885 (Number of characters: 215):
Moreover, there are many survivors in whom both angering and
crying are blocked. They also benefit inordinately from rescuing the healing balm of both anger
and tears from the stultifying prohibitions of the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1886 (Number of characters: 83):
If you are unable cry or feel angry, focusing on your breath may help you to emote.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1887 (Number of characters: 414):
This is
especially true if you attend to the sensations in your abdominal region as it expands and
contracts during respiration. Deep, slow and rhythmic breathing stretches and expands various
visceral muscles and internal organs in ways that sometimes bring feelings into awareness. If this does not help, Holotropic Rebirthing and Reichian therapy employ special breathing
techniques to help free stuck emotions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1888 (Number of characters: 91):
I know many survivors who first reclaimed their capacity
to emote through these techniques.

3. Verbal Ventilation: The Golden Path To Intimacy
“Joy shared is doubled. Sorrow shared is halved.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1890 (Number of characters: 74):
- Old Chinese saying

Verbal ventilation is the third process of grieving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1891 (Number of characters: 709):
It is the penultimate resolver of
emotional flashbacks. Verbal ventilation is speaking or writing in a manner that airs out and
releases painful feelings. When we let our words spring from what we feel, language is imbued
with emotion, and pain can be released through what we say, think or write. As our grieving
proficiency increases, we can verbally ventilate about our losses, using shame-dissolving
language to tell the story of how we were unfairly deprived of our birthright to be welcomed into
a family that cherished us. My favorite technique to enhance verbal ventilation is to encourage the survivor to talk in
an uncensored manner about whatever comes to his mind while he focuses on his feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1892 (Number of characters: 680):
If his
feelings are not in awareness, focusing on bodily sensations can provide rich grist for verbally
venting. Verbal Ventilation is therapeutic to the degree that a person’s words are colored by and
descriptive of the anger, sadness, fear, shame and/or depression she feels. Ventilation that is
liberally punctuated with actual crying or angering is especially powerful. Theoretical Neuroscience Of Verbal Ventilation
Verbal ventilation is a tool that can remediate brain changes that are caused by Cptsd. Susan
Vaughan’s MRI research demonstrates that emotional flashbacks over-activate the emotionally
oriented right-brain and under-activate the thinking-oriented left-brain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1893 (Number of characters: 462):
With this hemispheric
polarization, there is an overwhelming reemergence of childhood pain that is emotionally
remembered by the memory-oriented right-brain. At the same time, the survivor loses access to
the higher cognitive functions of her left-brain. This temporary loss of cognitive perspective
explains why it is so hard for a survivor to realize that she is only flashing back, and not really
lost in the danger, helplessness and hopelessness of the past.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1894 (Number of characters: 573):
Verbal ventilation, at its most potent, is the therapeutic process of bringing left-brain
cognition to intense right-brain emotional activation. It fosters the recoveree’s ability to put
words to feelings, and ultimately to accurately interpret and communicate about his various
feeling states. When this process is repeated sufficiently, new neural pathways grow that allow
the left- and right-brain to work together so that the person can actually think and feel at the
same time. The corpus callosum is the part of the brain that connects the left and right hemispheres.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1895 (Number of characters: 75):
Research shows that the corpus callosum is smaller in some Cptsd survivors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1896 (Number of characters: 372):
Further research
shows that the brain can generate new neurons and new neuronal connections to remedy this
situation. Thinking And Feeling Simultaneously
When a survivor becomes proficient at verbal ventilation, she heals a crucial developmental
arrest. She learns to think about feeling states in a way that creates healthy, helpful and
appropriate responses to feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1897 (Number of characters: 89):
These responses are characteristically respectful to herself and
to whomever she is with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1898 (Number of characters: 690):
In his book, Emotional Intelligence, Daniel Goleman writes that this is
a core trait of emotional intelligence. With continued practice, verbal ventilation coordinates the left and right hemispheres of the

brain so that whenever the right-brain is hyper-activated in flashback, the left-brain is also fully
engaged [this also can be seen in an MRI]. With the left-brain back on line, the survivor can
remember to use the flashback management steps to successfully help manage a flashback. As with angering and crying, verbal ventilation is only effective when it is liberated from
the critic’s control. In early recovery, verbal ventilation can easily shift into verbal self-
flagellation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1899 (Number of characters: 531):
Verbally ventilating from the self-attacking or drasticizing perspective of the critic is
rarely effective grieving. Instead it typically triggers or intensifies flashbacks, which in turn
frequently generates self- and intimacy-injuring behavior. Many survivors in early recovery are unable to notice their unconscious shifts into over-
identifying with the critic’s point of view. When this is the case, they usually need the help of a
therapist or sufficiently recovered intimate to help them recognize and neutralize the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1900 (Number of characters: 68):
Verbal Ventilation is an especially transformative grieving process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1901 (Number of characters: 452):
It not only promotes the
same type of fear-release and shame-dissolution as angering and crying, but also helps to expose
the manifold guises of the critic’s self-attack and fear-arousal programs. Verbal ventilation also
helps us to identify and communicate about needs that have long been unmet because of our
childhood abandonment. Verbally Ventilating Alone
Verbally venting alone, where no one else can hear you, is a helpful therapeutic technique.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1902 (Number of characters: 83):
Untraumatized children do it frequently in their play, much to their great benefit.

If your room is
not private, you can drive your car to somewhere that is.

chunk 1904 (Number of characters: 88):
Typically it takes considerable silencing of the critic to regain this therapeutic tool.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1905 (Number of characters: 127):
This
tool is so powerful and restorative that it is worth many skirmishes with the critic to reclaim it for
your Cptsd toolbox.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1906 (Number of characters: 102):
One of my clients kept an 18” length of rubber hose and a phone book on the passenger seat
of her car.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1907 (Number of characters: 180):
During the year that she was doing the lion’s share of her anger work, she would hit
the hose loudly on the phonebook whenever her brainwashing, abusive father came up in her
mind.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1908 (Number of characters: 141):
She would of course pull over for this, and found over time that she could do it
inconspicuously in places with surprisingly limited privacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1909 (Number of characters: 71):
It was remarkable to me how much
critic-shrinking she did in that year.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1910 (Number of characters: 400):
Dissociation Deadens Verbal Ventilation
It is important to differentiate verbal ventilation from dissociative flights of fantasy and
obsessive bouts of unproductive worrying. Dissociation is a defense that children develop to
distract and protect themselves from the overwhelming pain of their abandonment. As
unsupported children, we have to dissociate because we are not able to effectively grieve.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1911 (Number of characters: 476):
We
have to protect ourselves by not allowing the full brunt of our pain into awareness. As we saw in chapter 6, there are two common types of dissociation: right-brain
dissociation and left-brain dissociation. Right-brain dissociation can be seen as classical dissociation and as the defense most
common to freeze types. It is the right-brain process of numbing out against intense feeling or
incessant inner critic attack. Dissociation is once again a process of distraction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1912 (Number of characters: 96):
Survivors

commonly experience it as getting lost in fantasy, fogginess, TV, tiredness or sleep.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1913 (Number of characters: 377):
Verbally reporting from a place of self-distraction is in fact the opposite of verbal
ventilation. Getting lost in daydream-like descriptions of improbable salvation fantasies is a
common way that clients avoid their pain in a therapy session. Another common example is
recounting long elaborate dreams that are devoid of emotional content or serious attempts at
introspection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1914 (Number of characters: 148):
Early in my career, I worked briefly with a freeze-fight type client who was stuck in an
avoidance process of endlessly monologing about her dreams.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1915 (Number of characters: 52):
Dina recalled them in lifeless,
excruciating detail.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1916 (Number of characters: 92):
In fact, her deadened delivery was emblematic of the way she talked about
almost everything.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1917 (Number of characters: 455):
Dina was an intern-therapist who locked up her vulnerability with a belief that dream work
was the piece de resistance of therapy. My attempts to guide her into exploring her deeper

unfortunately not experienced enough at the time to help her see that this was a dissociative
defense that she had constructed as a child to protect herself from a very intrusive mother.

Left-Brain Dissociation
Left-brain dissociation is obsessiveness. Commonly, this ranges in severity from dwelling on a
singular worry… to repetitively cycling through a list of worries… to panicky drasticizing and
catastrophizing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1920 (Number of characters: 180):
This type of dissociation from internal pain strands the survivor in unhelpful
ruminations about issues that are unrelated or minimally related to the true nature of her
suffering.

This is an example of this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1922 (Number of characters: 262):
Your friend complains incessantly about the bad weather or the
unfairness of people who do not use their turn signals. He cannot stop grumbling because no

grievance.

Left-brain dissociation can also be a process of trivialization.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1925 (Number of characters: 128):
This occurs when the survivor
over-focuses on superficial external concerns to distract himself from upsetting inner experience.

Verbal Ventilation Heals Abandonment

When we share what is emotionally important to us, we learn to connect with others in a
meaningful and healing way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1932 (Number of characters: 243):
This applies to sharing concerns that excite and please us, as well
as those that frighten or depress us. Perhaps there was no more detrimental consequence of our
childhood abandonment than being forced to habitually hide our authentic selves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1933 (Number of characters: 123):
Many of us
come out of childhood believing that what we have to say is as uninteresting to others as it was

We must repudiate this damaging legacy of the past.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1935 (Number of characters: 515):
Verbal ventilation is the key way that
people make friends. It parallels the way tender touch, soothing voice, and welcoming facial
expressions helps infants and toddlers establish bonding and attachment. When we practice the
emotionally based communication of verbal ventilation in a safe environment, we repair the
damage of not having had this need met in childhood. This in turn opens up the possibility of
finally attaining the verbal-emotional intimacy that is an essential lifelong need for all human
beings.

chunk 1936 (Number of characters: 80):
Committing to this type of practice typically requires courage and perseverance.

chunk 1939 (Number of characters: 529):
Verbal Ventilation And Intimacy
Reciprocal verbal ventilation is the highway to intimacy in adult relationships. Sufficient practice
with a safe enough other brings genuine experiences of comforting and restorative connection. For me and many of my clients, such experiences are more alleviating of loneliness than we had
ever thought possible. Nowhere is this truer than with mutual commiseration. Mutual commiseration is the process
in which two intimates are reciprocally sympathetic to each other’s troubles and difficulties.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1940 (Number of characters: 607):
It is
the deepest most intimate channel to intimacy – profounder than sex. Mutual commiseration also
typically promotes a spontaneous opening into many levels of light-hearted and spontaneous
connecting. As deep and meaningful connection with another becomes more available and frequent, the
survivor increasingly experiences the shrinking of his abandonment depression. I must reiterate here that some popular bodywork approaches to trauma belittle the
usefulness of talk therapy. While somatic work is a vital tool of recovery, it alone cannot shrink
your toxic critic or resuscitate your self-expression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1941 (Number of characters: 220):
Cognitive work, especially that which is
empowered by verbal ventilation, is fundamental to Cptsd recovery. With that said, we will move on to Feeling, the fourth grieving process – a process that is a

Feeling: Passively Working Through Grief

“Feeling is the antithesis of pain…the more pain one feels, the less pain one suffers”
– Arthur Janov
Ongoing engagement in the active grieving processes of angering, crying and verbal ventilation
can help us to discover the fourth grieving process: Feeling. Feeling is a subtler, passive process than emoting. It is best illustrated by contrasting the
concepts of emoting and feeling. Emoting is when we cry, anger out, or verbally ventilate the
energy of an inner emotional experience. Feeling, on the other hand, is the inactive process of
staying present to internal emotional experience without reacting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1945 (Number of characters: 333):
In recovery then, feeling is
surrendering to our internal experiences of pain without judging or resisting them, and without
emoting them out. Feeling is a kinesthetic rather than a cognitive experience. It is the process of shifting the
focus of your awareness off of thinking and onto your affects, energetic states and sensations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1946 (Number of characters: 602):
It
is the proverbial “getting out of your head” and “getting into your body.” As a grieving process, feeling involves consciously reversing the learned survival
mechanism of clamping down on pain to banish it from awareness. Feeling “occurs” when we direct our attention to an emotionally or physically painful state,
and surrender to this experience without resistance. When we relax acceptingly into our pain, we
can learn to gently absorb it into our experience. Feeling then functions as if our awareness is a
solvent that dissolves and metabolizes the affect, energy and sensation of our emotions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1947 (Number of characters: 311):
Feeling Can Heal Digestive Problems
The practice of feeling is also similar to healthy food digestion whereby a relaxed digestive tract
allows us to effectively assimilate nutrients. If, however, we suppress or repress our feelings, our
bodies typically armor and tighten, especially along the alimentary canal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1948 (Number of characters: 339):
I believe digestive tract-tightening can create the types of digestive problems that frequently
co-occur with Cptsd. Diarrhea, for instance, is sometimes an emotionally-caused, physical
response to intense danger. When this occurs, fear triggers the sympathetic nervous system into
further triggering an immediate evacuation of the bowels.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1949 (Number of characters: 29):
Nausea can operate similarly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1950 (Number of characters: 525):
Constipation, on the other hand, is sometimes a tightening in the alimentary canal that hampers
the peristaltic motion necessary for healthy evacuation. The Emotional-Physical Connection
There is often a close relationship between emotion and physical sensation. Physical sensations
in the body often co-occur with feelings. Moreover, sensations of tightness and tension can
develop as a defense against feelings. As unexpressed feelings accumulate, a greater degree of
muscular tension is necessary to keep them under wraps.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1951 (Number of characters: 409):
A child who is repeatedly punished for emoting learns to be afraid of inner emotional
experience and tightens [armors] the musculature of her body in an effort to hold feelings in and
to banish them from awareness. Holding your breath is a further manifestation of armoring. It is an especially common way
of keeping feelings at bay, as breathing naturally brings your awareness down to the level of

feeling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1952 (Number of characters: 546):
As my client, Kylie, free associated on the feelings of a particularly intense flashback, she
painfully recalled the traumas she underwent trying to avoid her mother’s punishments for
crying. Her worst memory was of the day in the supermarket, when her mother’s scolding rained
down upon her as she tried to suppress her rapidly mounting urge to cry. Knowing the worst
punishment would ensue if she cried, she held her breath to hold back the tears. She held it so
long that she fainted from lack of oxygen and cracked her head open on the floor.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1953 (Number of characters: 103):
Her mother,
mortified by what she saw as public humiliation, beat her black and blue when she got home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1954 (Number of characters: 553):
It took us two years of trust-building work to bring this incident back into awareness. She
then cried her first tears since when it happened, three decades earlier. These were also the first
tears she could ever remember that brought relief. The technique of focusing your awareness on physical sensations in your body can help you
to become more proficient at the practice of “feeling”. With enough practice, paying attention to
tightness in your face, throat, heart or belly area brings feelings into awareness, where they can
simply be felt through.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1955 (Number of characters: 712):
However, in your early experiences of focusing on sensations, feelings
may come up so strongly that you will benefit from allowing yourself to emote them. Balancing Feeling And Emoting
When we become more mindful of the subtle sensations of feelings, the passive grieving process
of feeling through them complements the active processes of grieving them out. We are typically
in advanced recovery when we can both emote out and feel through our anger, sadness, fear,
shame and depression. Furthermore, feeling also helps us to bring emotions into awareness that need to be grieved
out through active, cathartic emoting. Thus, grieving is especially profound when we can fluidly
shift between feeling and emoting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1956 (Number of characters: 668):
Sometimes we will only need to fully feel and accept the
sensations of our pain. Other times we will want to verbally ventilate about our pain with
someone who gives us full permission to color our words with angering and tears. Learning To Feel
As a survivor becomes more adept at angering and crying, fear of his feelings will decrease, and
opportunities to learn to simply feel will present themselves. He can engage these opportunities
by passively attuning to the more subtle sensations of his anger and sadness. Over time this practice will build his ability to stay passively present to the sensations of his
deeper feelings – to his fear, shame and depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1957 (Number of characters: 433):
But in early stages, this awareness will often
morph into the need to actively emote them out – to grieve himself out of the abandonment
mélange. Eventually, however, his abandonment mélange feelings will also be digested and
worked through purely with the solvent of awareness. This also applies to anxiety which is often
fear just below the level of awareness. With sufficient practice, anxiety can often be felt through
passively.

We will explore this process in greater depth in the next chapter.

An Exercise In Feeling

Here is an exercise to help you enhance your ability to feel and grieve through pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1960 (Number of characters: 545):
Visualize
yourself as time-traveling back to a place in the past when you felt especially abandoned. See
your adult self taking your abandoned child onto your lap and comforting her in various painful
emotional states or situations. You can comfort her/him verbally: “I feel such sorrow that you
were so abandoned and that you felt so alone so much of the time. I love you even more when
you are stuck in this abandonment pain – especially because you had to endure it for so long with
no one to comfort you. That shouldn’t have happened to you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1961 (Number of characters: 33):
It shouldn’t happen to any child.

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1968 (Number of characters: 129):
I highly recommend practicing this even if it feels inauthentic, and even if it requires a great
deal of fending off your critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1969 (Number of characters: 452):
Keep practicing and eventually, you will have a genuine
experience of feeling self-compassion for the traumatized child you were. When that occurs, you
will know that your recovery work had reached a deep level. Techniques To Invite And Enhance Grieving
Tears were hard to come by after my first breakthrough cry in early adulthood. I would often
long for the incredible relief I felt on that occasion, but unlike angering, I could not force my
crying.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1970 (Number of characters: 57):
I have come to learn that this is typical of many people.

Finally, if reading this book does not begin to release the critic’s stranglehold on your ability to
grieve, please consider working with a therapist or support group to help you work through the
shame that the critic uses to spoil your ability to grieve. THE MAP: MANAGING THE ABANDONMENT DEPRESSION
Cptsd burdens us with a hair-trigger susceptibility to painful emotional flashbacks. Flashbacks,
as we have seen, are layers of defensive reactions to the abandonment depression. These
reactions include physical, behavioral, cognitive, emotional and relational responses to the
reemerging sense of danger and despair that plagued our childhood abandonment. This chapter presents a map of these layered, defensive reactions to abandonment pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1998 (Number of characters: 726):
This
map shows you which reactions are most important to work on at any given time. It includes a
strategy for reducing harmful reactions that are no longer necessary. This strategy involves self-
compassionately soothing yourself when you are trapped in fear and/or depression, so that you
do not launch into intensified fear, toxic shame, critic attacks, or self-damaging 4F reactions. Cycles Of Reactivity
This section presents a verbal diagram of the layering of our reactions in an emotional flashback. Experiences of depression and abandonment trigger us into fear and shame, which then activates
panicky inner critic thinking, which in turn launches us into an adrenalized fight, flight, freeze or
fawn trauma response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1999 (Number of characters: 55):
This is how that reactivity takes place in a flashback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2000 (Number of characters: 798):
A survivor wakes up feeling
depressed. Because childhood experience has conditioned her to believe that she is unworthy and
unacceptable in this state, she feels anxious and ashamed. This in turn activates her inner critic to
scare her with perfectionistic rants: “No wonder no one likes me. I’ve got to get my lazy,
worthless ass out of bed or I’ll end up like that homeless, bag lady in the park!”
Retraumatized by her own inner voice, she then launches into her most habitual 4F
behavior. She either lashes out domineeringly at the nearest person [Fight] – or she launches
busily into anxious productivity [Flight] – or she flips on the TV and foggily tunes out or dozes
off again [Freeze] – or she self-abandoningly redirects her attention to figuring out how to fix a

friend’s problem [Fawn].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2001 (Number of characters: 366):
All this typically happens so quickly that we do not notice the fear and shame, or the inner
critic. The first thing that we usually begin to notice in early recovery is that suddenly we are
engaged in our most typical 4F response. As recovery progresses we become aware of the critic. Eventually this promotes mindfulness of the fear and shame that fuel the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2002 (Number of characters: 84):
And finally in
later recovery, we become aware of the abandonment depression itself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2003 (Number of characters: 61):
Unfortunately this dynamic also commonly operates in reverse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2004 (Number of characters: 118):
This can occur in early recovery
when you suddenly notice that you have slipped back into a dysfunctional 4F behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2005 (Number of characters: 554):
This then
triggers you into new self-attacking criticism, which then amps up your fear and shame. This in
turn increases your abandonment depression as the process of self-abandonment runs riot. Desperate to escape the deathlike feelings of the abandonment depression, the initial cycle
revs up again. Depression creates fear and shame which fuels venomous critic attacks and
launches you into fighting, fleeing, freezing or fawning. Survivors can careen back and forth through these layered reactions creating perpetual
motion cycles of internal trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2006 (Number of characters: 128):
I believe this process also accounts for the spiraling down feeling that many survivors
report having during intense flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2007 (Number of characters: 175):
This is a diagram of these dynamics:
ABANDONMENT DEPRESSION

Let us look at a case example of how triggering works in the reverse direction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2008 (Number of characters: 93):
My mega-
perfectionistic, flight-type client, Mario, came into our session five minutes late.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2009 (Number of characters: 63):
It was the first
time he had been late in two years of therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2010 (Number of characters: 205):
Mario was in full-fledged flight, sweating from racing up the hill from his parking space a
block away. He told me he just could not sit on the couch today. Could he please just pace in
front of the couch.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2011 (Number of characters: 19):
“I hate being late.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2012 (Number of characters: 82):
I won’t tell you - please don’t ask – just how fast I was
driving on the freeway!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2013 (Number of characters: 195):
Mario compulsively paced, but this driven-ness was nothing compared to the speed of his
obsessing, as he rattled off many versions of most of the inner critic attack programs listed in
chapter 9.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2014 (Number of characters: 78):
To him, his being late was merely the tip of the iceberg of his defectiveness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2015 (Number of characters: 134):
As his rant
against himself amped up, he increasingly scared himself with his own words, and shamed
himself with his parents’ disgust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2016 (Number of characters: 414):
Finally, seemingly exhausted, Mario collapsed on the couch, and launched into the first
suicidal ideation I had ever heard from him. He had just landed in the pit of the abandonment
mélange [depression encrusted with fear and shame] and was sinking to the bottom into a
despairing depression of helplessness and hopelessness. This was the real helplessness and
hopelessness that had so characterized his childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2017 (Number of characters: 100):
Fortunately, I had been diligently planting seeds about his need to grieve over the last two

years.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2018 (Number of characters: 117):
For the first time since early childhood, the tears came, and it was the most moving
monsoon I had witnessed in ages.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2019 (Number of characters: 99):
He cried for the little forsaken boy he had been. He came
home, via his pain, to being on his side.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2020 (Number of characters: 100):
The long exile into self-abandonment was temporarily
over for the first time that he could remember.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2021 (Number of characters: 84):
We were then able to look at the cycle of reactivity that had turned into a cyclone.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2022 (Number of characters: 506):
Triggered by a traffic jam into the “terrible danger” of being late, Cptsd launched him into his
flight response as he raced to get to my office. The flight response also immediately triggered the
inner critic to attack him for his lateness and to catastrophize about the consequences. As it did
he fell deeper and deeper into shame and fear, and then ultimately into the abandonment
depression itself. This time however, Mario broke the flashback with his tears, as his crying released his fear
and shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2023 (Number of characters: 404):
This in turn defueled his critic and allowed his body to begin releasing the
hyperarousal of his flight response. Had he not been able to do this, he most likely would have continued attacking himself with
shame-fueled perfectionism and fear-fueled drasticizing. He would then have launched out of the
session back to obsessively and compulsively racing through his day driven by his infinite to-do
list.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2024 (Number of characters: 275):
The Layers Of Dissociation In The Cycle Of Reactivity
All the layered reactions in the cycle of reactivity are defenses against the abandonment
depression. Each layer is also a defense against all of the other layers beneath it. As such, each
layer is a type of dissociation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2025 (Number of characters: 498):
When we are triggered and lost in a 4F response, we fight, flee,
freeze or fawn to disassociate ourselves from the painful voice of the critic. On a deeper layer,
the critic is also distracting and disassociating us from our emotional pain. Moreover, fear and
shame dis-associate us from the bottom layer - the terrible abandonment depression itself. Dissociation [the psychological term for disassociation], then, is the process of rendering all
these levels less conscious or totally unconscious.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2026 (Number of characters: 522):
As recovery progresses and we learn to stay present enough to the critic to begin shrinking
it, we become increasingly aware of the fear and shame that underlies it. With sufficient feeling
into fear and shame, we notice that fear and shame cover up the deadened feelings of the
abandonment depression itself. Learning to stay self-supportingly present to the feelings of this
depression is the deepest level, bottom-of-the-barrel work of recovery. When we are able to do
this, our recovering has reached a profound level.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2027 (Number of characters: 438):
Parental Abandonment Creates Self-Abandonment
Once again, we had to dissociate with these layered defenses because we were not
developmentally capable of managing the pain of being abandoned. We could not tolerate feeling
the fear, shame and inconsolableness of it. We could not use our anger and tears to release this
shame and fear. We could not bear to stay tuned in to the incessantly persecutory critic, over
which we were powerless.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2028 (Number of characters: 42):
We could only fight, flee, freeze or fawn.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2029 (Number of characters: 436):
Over time this elaborate
cycle of self-abandonment became habitual. Chronic emotional abandonment devastates a child. It naturally makes her feel and appear

deadened and depressed. Functional parents respond to a child’s depression with concern and
comfort. Abandoning parents respond to the child with anger, disgust and/or further
abandonment, which in turn exacerbate the fear, shame and despair that become the
abandonment mélange.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2030 (Number of characters: 684):
Deconstructing Self-Abandonment
Because of our parents’ rejection, the mildest hint of depression, no matter how functional or
appropriate, can instantly flash us back into our original abandonment depression. The capacity
to self-nurturingly weather any experience of depression, no matter how mild, remains
unrealized. Our original experience of parental abandonment has morphed into habitual self-
abandonment. We can gradually deconstruct the self-abandoning habit of reacting to depression with fear
and shame, inner critic catastrophizing, and 4F acting out. The mindfulness processes described
below awaken the psyche’s innate capacity to respond with compassion to depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2031 (Number of characters: 601):
Mindfulness also helps us metabolize the fear and shame that we were forced to feel about being
depressed. Ending our reactivity to depression is typically a long difficult journey. This is because our
culture routinely humiliates us for any expression of depression. It pathologizes us as if we are
violating our patriotic duty to be fully engaged in “the pursuit of happiness.”
Taboos about depression even emanate from the psychological establishment, where some
schools strip it of its status as a legitimate feeling. For them, depression is nothing more than a
waste product of negative thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2032 (Number of characters: 541):
Other schools reduce it simplistically to a dysfunctional state
that results from the repression of somewhat less taboo emotions like sadness and anger. This is
not to say that these factors cannot cause depression. It is to say that depression is a legitimate
feeling that often contains the helpful and important information described below. Depressed Thinking Versus Feeling Depressed
Healing progresses when we learn to distinguish depressed thinking [which we need to
eliminate] from depressed feeling [which we sometimes need to feel].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2033 (Number of characters: 622):
Occasional feelings of
listlessness and anhedonia [inability to enjoy our usual pleasures] are normal and existential. A
modicum of ennui and dissatisfaction are part of the price of admission to life. Moreover, depression is sometimes an invaluable herald of the need to slow down for rest
and restoration. When depression is most helpful, it gives us access to a unique spring of
intuition, such as that which informs us that a once valued job or relationship is no longer healthy
for us. In such instances we feel depressed because some irreparable change has rendered some
central thing in our lives detrimental to us.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2034 (Number of characters: 498):
This functional depression is signaling us to let it die
and move on. Overreaction to depression essentially reinforces learned toxic shame. It reinforces the
person’s belief that he is unworthy, defective and unlovable when he is depressed. Sadly this typically drives him deeper into abandonment-exacerbating isolation. Mindfulness Metabolizes Depression

Deep level recovery from childhood trauma requires a normalization of depression, a
renunciation of the habit of reflexively reacting to it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2035 (Number of characters: 555):
Central to this is the development of a self-
compassionate mindfulness. Once again, mindfulness is the practice of staying in your body –
the practice of staying fully present to all of your internal experience. The practice of mindfulness cultivates our ability to stay acceptingly open to our emotional,
visceral and somatic experience without retreating into the cycle of reactivity. Steven Levine’s
beautiful book, Who Dies, is an enlightening, jargon-less and easily accessible guide book on
learning the practice of mindfulness. Somatic Mindfulness

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2036 (Number of characters: 617):
Because depression in Cptsd commonly morphs instantly into fear, early mindfulness work
involves staying present to the physical sensations of fearful hyperarousal. This technique is also
known as sensate focusing and it is the practice of feeling we explored in the last chapter. Mild
sensations of fear are muscular tightness or tension anywhere in the body, especially in the
alimentary canal. Tension in the jaw, throat, chest, diaphragm or belly also often correlates with
fear. More intense sensations of fear are nausea, jumpiness, feeling wired, shortness of breath,
hyperventilation, and alimentary distress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2037 (Number of characters: 848):
Mindfulness also involves noticing the psyche’s penchant to dissociate from these
uncomfortable sensations. Once again, dissociation can be the classical right-brain distraction of
spacing out into reverie or sleep, or the left-brain, cognitive distraction of worrying and
obsessing. Over and over, the survivor will need to rescue himself from dissociation, and gently bring
his awareness back into fully feeling the sensations of his fear. Although sensations of fear
sometimes feel unbearable at first, persistent focusing with non-reactive attention dissolves and
resolves them as if awareness itself is digesting and integrating them. Somatic Awareness Can Therapeutically Trigger Painful Memories
Somatic awareness and sensate focusing sometimes opens up memories and unworked through
feelings of grief about your childhood abuse and neglect.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2038 (Number of characters: 108):
This phenomenon provides invaluable,
therapeutic opportunities to more fully grieve the losses of childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2039 (Number of characters: 134):
If more pain comes up
then you can digest on your own, please consider getting someone more experienced to help you
with this process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2040 (Number of characters: 123):
With considerable practice, you can begin to exhume from your fear an awareness of the
underlying sensations of depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2041 (Number of characters: 186):
These are hypo-aroused sensations that are subtle and
barely perceptible at first. They may include heaviness, swollenness, exhaustion, emptiness,
hunger, longing, soreness, or deadness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2042 (Number of characters: 80):
These sensations are initially as difficult to stay present to as those of fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2043 (Number of characters: 610):
With ongoing
practice however, focused attention also digests them as they are integrated into consciousness. One of the biggest challenges of mindfully focusing on depression is to not dissociate into sleep. Sitting up straight in a comfortable chair can help to keep you awake and focused on fully
feeling and metabolizing your depression. As practice becomes more accomplished, these feelings and sensations of depression can

morph into a sense of peace, relaxation and ease. On special occasions, they sometimes open to
an underlying, innate core emotional experience of clarity, well-being and belonging.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2044 (Number of characters: 26):
Introspective Somatic Work

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2045 (Number of characters: 110):
I began my journey of learning how to feel by devoting a half hour daily to feeling the sensations
of my fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2046 (Number of characters: 306):
This was extremely difficult because I had survived my childhood with ADHD-like
busyness. I had run daily marathons of activity to keep myself one step ahead of my fear and my
shame-saturated depression. As an adult, I reduced this to half-marathons but I was still a
busyholic, despite my relaxed persona.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2047 (Number of characters: 510):
Tuning into how wired I was, was daunting. In my
attempts to become more mindful, I was often exasperated by how frequently my awareness fled
my body and went back into thinking or daydreaming. In the first few months, my focus wavered wildly between feeling the tense sensations of
my fear and being disrupted by inner critic thinking. I was assailed by a plethora of
catastrophizing thoughts and visualizations. My critic repeatedly misinterpreted my fear as if I
were still entrapped in my hazardous family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2048 (Number of characters: 59):
My critic goaded me incessantly to launch into flight-mode.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2049 (Number of characters: 144):
I was so itching to get going
that I had strange tantalizing fantasies of cleaning my apartment, normally one of my least
favorite things to do.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2050 (Number of characters: 137):
In the first year of this practice, I frequently had to white-knuckle the
handles on my chair to stay somatically present to my feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2051 (Number of characters: 598):
Otherwise, I would have been off
and running into self-medicating with excessive adrenalization. Dissolving Depression By Fully Feeling It
Gradually, my focused awareness began to metabolize my fear. Many months later, I was
typically able to relax the tense fearful sensations of a flashback within ten minutes. As I became
more successful at digesting my fear, I experientially discovered the rock bottom underlying core
sensations of my abandonment depression itself. Mindful merging with the subtle emotions and sensations of depression is the finishing tool
of deconstructing self-abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2052 (Number of characters: 387):
Over and over I focused on the sensations of my
depression. Occasionally these sensations were intense, but more often they were very subtle. Often it was difficult to resist the urge to fall asleep, and many times I could not. At other times, I noticed how instantly my depression scared me back into fear. Simultaneously the sensations of depression also triggered me into toxic shame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2053 (Number of characters: 237):
Often, I would
witness myself echoing my parents’ contempt: “…bad, lazy, worthless, good-for-nothing, stick-
in-the-mud, etc.”
Blessedly, with ongoing practice, I gradually learned to dis-identify from the toxic
vocabulary of the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2054 (Number of characters: 46):
I also learned to stay awake most of the time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2055 (Number of characters: 230):
I then found myself more
accurately naming these revisited childhood feelings: “Small, helpless, lonely, unsupported,
unloved.” Over time, this in turn rewarded me with a profound sense of compassion for the
abandoned child I was.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2056 (Number of characters: 154):
Moreover, I made the wonderful discovery that sensate focusing, when it has been well
practiced and developed, is the ultimate thought-stopping technique.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2057 (Number of characters: 165):
When the critic is especially

loud and persistent, shifting your awareness from thinking to feeling your sensations is a potent
way of coming home to a safer place.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2058 (Number of characters: 400):
It is, as one survivor told me, “coming home to rest in the
mother of your body.” In my current recovery work, I most commonly apply this mindfulness technique to
experiences of survival-mode depression. For me this low grade manifestation of the
abandonment depression typically gets triggered by a few nights of poor sleep, which often
decreases my energy level and dulls my ability to concentrate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2059 (Number of characters: 689):
Most of my life, this feeling
experience provided rich fodder for my critic. Over the years however, increased mindfulness
allows me to see that I typically function well enough no matter how tired or introverted I feel. These days, I am sometimes even able to authentically welcome the most exhausted of these
experiences as a chance to take a break from my less essential routines. I have learned how to
resist my critic’s all-or-none productivity program, and be satisfied with days of getting less
done.
Hunger As Camouflaged Depression
Feelings of abandonment commonly masquerade as the physiological sensations of hunger. Hunger pain soon after a big meal is rarely truly about food.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2060 (Number of characters: 92):
Typically it is camouflaged
emotional hunger and the longing for safe, nurturing connection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2061 (Number of characters: 51):
Food cannot satiate the hunger
pain of abandonment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2062 (Number of characters: 24):
Only loving support can.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2063 (Number of characters: 618):
Geneen Roth’s book offers powerful self-help
book on this subject. Even after a decade of practice, I still find it difficult to differentiate this type of attachment
hunger from physical hunger. One often reliable clue is that the sensation of longing for the
nourishment of attachment is usually in my small intestine, while physical hunger’s locus is a
little higher up in my stomach. When I can take the time to meditate on this lower abdomen
sensation, I often become aware that I am in a low level flashback. Feeling through this
uncomfortable sensation typically resolves both the flashback and my false hunger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2064 (Number of characters: 561):
I believe this type of emotional hunger is at the core of most food addictions. One of the
reasons food addictions are so difficult to manage is that food was the first source of self-
comforting that was available to us. With the dearth of any other comfort, there is little wonder
that we came to over-rely on eating for nurturance. In fact, like Gabor Mate, I believe that attachment hunger is at the core of most addictive
behavior, even process addictions. An example of the latter is the sex and love addict’s desperate
pursuit of high intensity relating.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2065 (Number of characters: 125):
Perhaps all addictive behavior is our misguided attempts to
self-medicate deeper abandonment pain and unmet attachment needs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2066 (Number of characters: 18):
Pseudo-Cyclothymia

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2067 (Number of characters: 351):
On a parallel with false hunger, feeling tired is sometimes unrelated to sleep deprivation. It is
instead an emotional experience of the abandonment depression. I believe that emotional
tiredness comes from not resting enough in a safe relationship with yourself or with another. This
emotional exhaustion often masquerades as physiological tiredness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2068 (Number of characters: 69):
Unfortunately, over time, the
two can become confusingly intertwined.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2069 (Number of characters: 669):
When our abandonment depression is unremediated, either kind of tiredness can trigger us

into fear. This then activates the inner critic which then translates “tired” into “endangering
imperfection,” which in turn triggers us into a 4F response. Ironically, over-reacting to emotional tiredness eventually creates real physical exhaustion
via a process I call The Cyclothymic Two-Step. The cyclothymic two-step is the dance of flight
types or subtypes who habitually overreact to their tiredness with workaholic or busyholic
activity. Self-medicating with their own adrenalin, they “run” to counteract the emotional
tiredness of the unprocessed abandonment depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2070 (Number of characters: 591):
Eventually however, many exhaust themselves physically, and become temporarily too
depleted or sick to continue running. At such times, they collapse into an accumulated depression
so painful, that they re-launch desperately into “flight-speed” at the first sign of replenished
adrenalin. Survivors with this pattern sometimes misdiagnose themselves as bipolar because of
their abrupt vacillations between adrenalin highs and abandonment-exacerbated lows. Also noteworthy here is the futile journey that many survivors undergo treating emotional
tiredness with physiologically-based methods.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2071 (Number of characters: 103):
The limited efficacy of such an approach however
typically augments their shame: “What’s wrong with me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2072 (Number of characters: 72):
I’ve changed everything in my diet and
in my sleep and exercise regimen.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2073 (Number of characters: 126):
I’ve taken every available supplement and seen every type of
practitioner imaginable, and I still wake up feeling dead tired.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2074 (Number of characters: 70):
There is a healthy way out of this cul-de-sac of misdirected striving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2075 (Number of characters: 114):
It lies in cultivating
self-kindness during those inevitable times when you feel tired, bad, lonely, or depressed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2076 (Number of characters: 101):
In this
regard, the notable AA 12 Step acronym, HALT - Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired – can be
helpful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2077 (Number of characters: 150):
Accordingly, I recommend that you focus inside to see if you have flashed back into the
abandonment depression whenever you experience a HALT feeling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2078 (Number of characters: 102):
If you have, you can then
work to generate the internal, self-compassionate attention described above.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2079 (Number of characters: 227):
Separating Necessary Suffering From Unnecessary Suffering
You can sometimes gain motivation for this difficult work by seeing your depressed feelings as
messages from your inner child who is feeling as abandoned as he ever was.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2080 (Number of characters: 105):
Perhaps this time
you can come to him with your remothering-self in a more comforting and protective way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2081 (Number of characters: 456):
Through such practice, you can gradually achieve the healing that Buddhists call separating
necessary suffering [normal fear and depression] from unnecessary suffering [unconscious self-
abandonment to helplessness, toxic shame, Cptsd fear, retraumatizing inner critic acting in, and
4F acting out]. Recovery Is Progressive
I begin this section by repeating the chapter 4 section: “Stages of Recovery.” This section
outlines the overall course of recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2082 (Number of characters: 127):
Hopefully you will notice, since you began reading this
book, that your understanding of Cptsd has been significantly enhanced.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2083 (Number of characters: 455):
I also hope that you
sense a greater sense of self-compassion and direction in your recovery process. “Although we often work on many levels of recovering at the same time, recovering is to some

degree progressive. It begins on the cognitive level when psychoeducation and mindfulness helps
us understand that we have Cptsd. This awakening then allows us to learn how to approach the
journey of deconstructing the various life-spoiling dynamics of Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2084 (Number of characters: 548):
Still on the cognitive level, we take our next steps into the long work of shrinking the critic. Some survivors will need to do a great deal of work on this level before they can move down to
the emotional layer of work, which is learning how to grieve effectively. The phase of intensely grieving our childhood losses can last for a couple of years. When
sufficient progress is made in grieving, the survivor naturally drops down into the next level of
recovery work. This involves working through fear by grieving our loss of safety in the world.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2085 (Number of characters: 733):
At
this level, we also learn to work through our toxic shame by grieving the loss of our self-esteem. As we become more adept in this type of deep level grieving, we are then ready to address
the core issue of our Cptsd – the abandonment depression itself. The final task here involves
releasing the armoring and physiological reactivity in our body to the abandonment depression
via the somatic work discussed in this chapter. This work culminates with learning to
compassionately support ourselves through our experiences of depression. Finally, as we will see in the next chapter, many survivors need some relational help in
achieving the complex tasks involved in deconstructing each layer of our old pain-exacerbating
defenses.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2086 (Number of characters: 520):
A Swiss Army Knife Approach To A Flashback
This is a final example of addressing all the layers of reactivity in resolving a flashback. When I started this work over three decades ago, I ate very poorly and did not know how to
soothe and nurture myself with healthy food. After some years of recovery work however, I deeply intuited that I needed to cook more in
order to take self-nurturance to the next level. I had not cooked more however because I hated to
cook. Luckily I embraced cooking anyway as a labor of love.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2087 (Number of characters: 89):
Nonetheless cooking was, for a
long time, a very trying and unpleasant experience for me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2088 (Number of characters: 95):
[This was, in fact, much like my
many years of struggling to get the upper hand on the critic].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2089 (Number of characters: 630):
But back to cooking which became a central piece of my self-remothering work. It was not
until I understood more about the dynamics of my flight response that I realized how much I
rushed around when I was cooking. Via increased mindfulness, I discovered that the smallest
unforeseen obstacle could set off what felt like a small electric shock in my chest. Examples of
these obstacles include something spilled, a lid too tight to open, an extra unanticipated task, or
the clock showing me that I was behind schedule. In an instant, anyone of these normal
hindrances could send me rushing around the kitchen in a low grade panic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2090 (Number of characters: 567):
Whenever this
occurred, I would then inhale my meal as soon as it was ready just to get the ordeal over with. This is an example of what a common, everyday flashback looks like in adulthood. It is so
often minor daily frustrations that trigger us into flashbacks, rather than incidents that repeat the
gross insults and ordeals of our childhoods. With ongoing recovery work, I realized that anything to do with food could easily flash me
back to the family dinner table - the battlefield of my dysfunctional family. Many productive grieving sessions came out of this.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2091 (Number of characters: 419):
They lead me to an epiphany that

doing anything intricate with lot of steps to it also flashed me back to feeling picked apart by my
parents. I subsequently discovered that angering at my parents, whenever I was triggered by
doing something complicated, significantly reduced my fear. There was, however, a huge part of my food trauma that I could not shrink until I started the
somatic work described in this chapter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2092 (Number of characters: 115):
Since then, years of practicing somatic mindfulness has greatly reduced my hair-triggerable
anxiety around cooking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2093 (Number of characters: 41):
This is however still a work in progress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2094 (Number of characters: 444):
In terms of the cycles of
reactivity, my occasional flashbacks around food and food preparation can look like this. I have
thirty minutes to cook and eat my breakfast before I leave for work. I come into the kitchen
and… “Oh No, The sink is full of the dishes that I forgot to clean last night!” I immediately
notice that I am about to launch into frenzied dish washing, when Flashback Management Step#
1 rises to the front of my consciousness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2095 (Number of characters: 26):
“I am having a flashback.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2096 (Number of characters: 266):
I go directly to Step# 7 and attempt to “ease back into my body.” I sit in my favorite stuffed
chair, close my eyes, and bring my awareness to my abdomen, where my anxiety typically makes
its most strident charge. I can feel tightness in and just below my diaphragm.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2097 (Number of characters: 86):
I feel afraid and get
a picture of my father’s big hand squeezing my small intestines.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2098 (Number of characters: 102):
I start to hypochondriasize about the possible long term effects of having this tension in my
abdomen.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2099 (Number of characters: 79):
My mindfulness instantly alerts me to invoke the thought-correction of Step# 8.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2100 (Number of characters: 333):
I
slowly repeat my current favorite anti-endangerment mantra: “I am safe; I am relaxing.” I slow and deepen my breath, and feel the muscles in my belly as much as I can. I feel the
slow cycle of these muscles relaxing and contracting with the ebbing and flowing of my breath. The cycle gradually becomes more fluid as I attend to it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2101 (Number of characters: 109):
After about fifty inhalations, I feel a swollen sensation of tiredness diffusing like ink
throughout my body.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2102 (Number of characters: 101):
My gut momentarily retightens to ward off that awful deadening feeling of
the abandonment depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2103 (Number of characters: 32):
But I surrender to the deadness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2104 (Number of characters: 137):
I do this because I know the tight feeling is fear and that it
will soon morph into the screaming critic excoriating me about being late.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2105 (Number of characters: 368):
I say no to the critic’s
Siren call of “you can do this if you hurry,” tempting me back into flight. I stay with the deadened, tired, lifeless feeling and try to feel it more, welcoming it. I sense
myself beginning to become one with the depressed sensation. Because I am so well practiced, the depression starts to gradually morph into a widening
sense of relaxation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2106 (Number of characters: 284):
It spreads throughout my body, and my body begins to feel like an easy-
chair. I look at my watch and it has taken twenty minutes of my “precious time.” I realize my
critic is trying to sneak back in and is goading me with the remark “it has taken twenty minutes
of my precious time.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2107 (Number of characters: 96):
I disidentify from the critic and shift into my refathering self and thought-correct the critic.

“It worked!”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2124 (Number of characters: 307):
This time I broke the cycle and did
not let my triggered flight response get much further than some momentary rushing. I stopped the cycle of reactivity from devolving into an inner critic diatribe against myself. I
didn’t indulge the outer critic and let it make me try to pin the undone dishes on my wife.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2125 (Number of characters: 171):
I chose
to stay with the depression. I bypassed the shame and fear that I have gotten stuck in ten
thousand times before when I could not accept my current state of being.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2126 (Number of characters: 146):
I refused to abandon
myself like the sinking ship I thought I was – like Helen and Charlie abandoned me as a kid on a
daily, hourly, yearly basis.

I am also happy to report that I now cook regularly, and triggering is relatively rare.

A RELATIONAL APPOACH TO HEALING ABANDONMENT
This chapter is a reworking of a professional article I wrote to guide therapists in their Cptsd
work. I have kept that point of reference in many sections of this chapter in the hope that it will
help you know what it is reasonable to expect from a therapist. Further on in this chapter, there is a section on how to find a therapist. I hope this
information will help you know what to look for, and ask for, when and if you are shopping for a
therapist. Finally, if therapy is not an option for you, I end the chapter with guidelines on how to
create a co-counseling relationship with a friend.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2130 (Number of characters: 768):
If that also is not possible, I list
recommendations for online forums where you can interact with others who are sharing about
their recovery journeys. The Relational Dimension Of Psychotherapy
Many Cptsd survivors have never had a “safe enough” relationship. Healing our attachment
disorders usually requires a reparative relational experience with a therapist, partner or trusted
friend who is able to stay compassionately present to their own painful and dysphoric feelings. It
is essential that they are comfortable with feeling and expressing their own sadness, anger, fear,
shame and depression. When a therapist has this level of emotional intelligence, she can guide the client to
gradually let go of the learned habit of automatically rejecting his feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2131 (Number of characters: 110):
This in turn also helps
him to avoid getting lost in the cycles of reactivity we explored in the last chapter.

Safe and empathic eye and voice connection with a therapist who has “good enough”
emotional intelligence models to the client how to stay acceptingly present to all her own affects. Daniel Siegel calls this the “coregulation of affect.” Moreover, Susan Vaughan’s work
demonstrates that this coregulation of affect promotes the development of the inner neural

circuitry necessary to metabolize overwhelmingly painful feelings. Furthermore, there is increasing neuroscientific evidence suggesting that this process is
physiologically accomplished through the agency of a set of neurons called mirror neurons. In
one experiment measuring neural activity in two monkeys, one monkey watched as the other
cracked open a nut.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2133 (Number of characters: 619):
The observer’s neural activity was identical to the performers. Perhaps
mirror neurons are involved when the client learns to be as non-reactive to his painful feelings as
the therapist. RELATIONAL HEALING IN COMPLEX PTSD
[Versions of the following article were first published in The Therapist and The East Bay
Therapist.] Many traumatologists see attachment disorder as one of the key symptoms of Complex PTSD. In
the psychoeducational phases of working with traumatized clients, I typically describe
attachment disorder as the result of growing up with primary caretakers who were regularly
experienced as dangerous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2134 (Number of characters: 382):
They were dangerous by contemptuous voice or heavy hand, or more
insidiously, dangerous by remoteness and indifference. Recurring abuse and neglect habituates children to living in fear and sympathetic nervous
system arousal. It makes them easily triggerable into the abandonment mélange of overwhelming
fear and shame that tangles up with the depressed feelings of being abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2135 (Number of characters: 273):
A child, with parents who are unable or unwilling to provide safe enough attachment, has
no one to whom she can bring her whole developing self. No one is there for reflection, validation and guidance. No one is safe enough to go to for
comfort or help in times of trouble.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2136 (Number of characters: 127):
There is no one to cry to, to protest unfairness to, and to seek
compassion from for hurts, mistakes, accidents, and betrayals.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2137 (Number of characters: 107):
No one is safe enough to shine with, to do “show and tell” with, and to be reflected as a
subject of pride.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2138 (Number of characters: 92):
There is no one to even practice the all-important intimacy-building skills of
conversation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2139 (Number of characters: 113):
In the paraphrased words of more than one of my clients: “Talking to Mom was like giving
ammunition to the enemy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2140 (Number of characters: 51):
Anything I said could and would be used against me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2141 (Number of characters: 216):
No wonder,
people always tell me that I don’t seem to have much to say for myself.” Those with Cptsd-spawned attachment disorders never learn the communication skills that
engender closeness and a sense of belonging.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2142 (Number of characters: 159):
When it comes to relating, they are often plagued
by debilitating social anxiety - and social phobia when they are at the severe end of the
continuum of Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2143 (Number of characters: 87):
Many of the clients who come through my door have never had a safe enough relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2144 (Number of characters: 435):
Repetition compulsion drives them to unconsciously seek out relationships in adulthood that
traumatically reenact the abusive and/or abandoning dynamics of their childhood caretakers. For many such clients, we are their first legitimate shot at a safe and nurturing relationship. If we are not skilled enough to create the degree of safety they need to begin the long journey
towards developing good enough trust, we may be their last.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2145 (Number of characters: 679):
Emotional flashback management, therefore, is empowered when it is taught in the context
of a safe relationship. Clients need to feel safe enough with their therapist to describe their

humiliation and overwhelm. At the same time, the therapist needs to be nurturing enough to
provide the empathy and calm support that was missing in the client’s early experience. Just as importantly, the therapist needs to be able to tolerate and work therapeutically with
the sudden evaporation of trust that is so characteristic of Cptsd. Trauma survivors do not have a
volitional “on” switch for trust, even though their “off” switch is frequently automatically
triggered during flashbacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2146 (Number of characters: 248):
In therapy, the therapist must be able to work on reassurance and
trust restoral over and over again. I have heard too many disappointing client stories about past
therapists who got angry at them because they would not simply choose to trust them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2147 (Number of characters: 860):
As the importance of this understanding ripens in me, I increasingly embrace an Intersubjective
or Relational approach. That means that I believe that the quality of the clients’ relationship with
me can provide a corrective emotional experience that saves them from being doomed to a
lifetime of superficial connection, or worse, social isolation and alienation. Moreover, I notice that without the development of a modicum of trust with me, my Cptsd
clients are seriously delimited in their receptivity to my guidance, as well as to the ameliorative
effects of my empathy. In this regard then, I will describe four key qualities of relating that I believe are essential to
the development of trust, and the subsequent relational healing that can come out of it. These are
Empathy, Authentic Vulnerability, Dialogicality and Collaborative Relationship Repair.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2148 (Number of characters: 141):
1. EMPATHY I used to assume that the merits of empathy were a given, but I have sadly heard too many stories
of empathy-impoverished therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2149 (Number of characters: 196):
In this regard, I will simply say here that if we are hard and
unsympathetic with our clients, we trigger the same sense of danger and abandonment in them
that they experienced with their parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2150 (Number of characters: 964):
In terms of a definition, I especially like Kohut’s statement that: “Empathy involves
immersing yourself in another’s psychological state by feeling yourself into the other’s
experience.” When I delve deeply enough into a client’s experience, no matter how initially perplexing
or intemperate it may at first seem, I inevitably find psychological sense in it, especially when I
recognize its flashback components. In fact, I can honestly say that I have never met a feeling or
behavior that did not make sense when viewed through the lenses of transference and
traumatology. Empathy, of course, deepens via careful listening and full elicitation of the client’s
experience, along with the time-honored techniques of mirroring and paraphrasing which show
the client the degree to which we get him. Noticing my subjective free associations often enhances my empathic attunement and
ability to reflect back to the client in an emotionally accurate and validating way.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2151 (Number of characters: 126):
When
appropriate, I sometimes share my autobiographical free associations with the client when they
are emotionally analogous.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2152 (Number of characters: 75):
I do this to let her know that I really empathize with what she is
sharing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2153 (Number of characters: 202):
This is an example of this. My client tells me with great embarrassment that she stayed
home all weekend because she had a pimple on her nose. She is ashamed of the pimple and of
her “vanity’’ about it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2154 (Number of characters: 75):
She moans: “How could I be so stupid to let such a little thing bother me?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2155 (Number of characters: 66):
I suddenly remember cancelling a date once when I had a cold sore.

a toxic shame attack.

chunk 2158 (Number of characters: 63):
She tears up and
then laughs, relieved as her shame melts away.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2159 (Number of characters: 74):
Months later, she tells me that her trust in me
mushroomed at that moment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2160 (Number of characters: 90):
Guidelines for being judicious about this kind of self-disclosure
will be discussed below.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2161 (Number of characters: 131):
Of the many benefits of empathy, the greatest is perhaps that it models and teaches self-
empathy, better known as self-acceptance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2162 (Number of characters: 150):
To the degree that we attune to and welcome all of the
client’s experience, to that same degree can the client learn to welcome it in her- or himself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2163 (Number of characters: 515):
2. AUTHENTIC VULNERABILITY “Realationship” Makes Healthy
Relationship
Authentic vulnerability is a second quality of intimate relating. Authentic vulnerability often
begins with emotionally reverberating with the client. I have found that emotional reflection of
the client’s feelings is irreplaceable in fostering the development of trust and real relational
intimacy. Emotional reflection requires the therapist to be emotionally vulnerable himself and reveal
that he too feels mad, sad, bad and scared sometimes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2164 (Number of characters: 809):
Modeling vulnerability, as with empathy,
demonstrates to the client the value of being vulnerable and encourages her to risk wading into
her own vulnerability. I came to value therapeutic vulnerability the hard way via its absence in my own therapy
with a therapist who was of the old, “blank screen” school. She was distant, laconic and over-
withholding in her commitment to the psychoanalytic principle of “optimal frustration.” Therapy
with her was actually counter-therapeutic and shame-exacerbating for me as we reenacted a
defective child/perfect parent dynamic. Therapeutic Emotional Disclosure
Thankfully, I eventually realized that I had unresolved attachment issues, and sought out a
Relational therapist who valued the use of her own vulnerable and emotionally authentic self as a
tool in therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2165 (Number of characters: 143):
Her tempered and timely emotional self-disclosures helped me to deconstruct the veneer of
invincibility I had built as a child to hide my pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2166 (Number of characters: 52):
Here are some examples that were especially
helpful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2167 (Number of characters: 33):
“God, the holidays can be awful.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2168 (Number of characters: 40):
“I get scared when I teach a class too.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2169 (Number of characters: 14):
“I’m so sorry.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2170 (Number of characters: 28):
I just missed what you said.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2171 (Number of characters: 196):
I got a little distracted by my anxiety about my dental appointment
this afternoon.” “I feel sad that your mother was so mean to you.” “It makes me angry that you
were so bullied by your parents.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2172 (Number of characters: 202):
My therapist’s modeling that anger, sadness, fear, and depression were emotions that could
be healthily expressed helped me to renounce the pain-repressing, emotional perfectionism in
which I was mired.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2173 (Number of characters: 75):
With her, I learned to stop burying my feelings in the hope of being loved.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2174 (Number of characters: 115):
I
renounced my just-get-over-it philosophy and embraced vulnerability as a way of finally getting

close to people.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2175 (Number of characters: 180):
I needed this kind of modeling, as so many of my clients have, to begin to emerge from my
fear of being attacked, shamed or abandoned for feeling bad and having dysphoric feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2176 (Number of characters: 638):
In
order to let go of my Sisyphean salvation fantasy of achieving constant happiness, I needed to
experience that all the less than shiny bits of me were acceptable to another human being. Seeing
that she was comfortable with and accepting of her own unhappy feelings eventually convinced
me that she really was not disgusted by mine. The therapist’s judicious use of emotional self-disclosure helps the client move out of the
slippery, shame-lined pit of emotional perfectionism. Here are some self-revealing things that I
say to encourage my clients to be more emotionally self-accepting. “I feel really sad about what
happened to you.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2177 (Number of characters: 70):
“I feel really angry that you got stuck with such a god-awful family.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2178 (Number of characters: 741):
“When
I’m temporarily confused and don’t know what to say or do, I…” “When I’m having a shame
attack, I…” “When something triggers me into fear, I…” “When my inner critic is overreacting,
I remind myself of the Winnicottian concept that I only have to be a ‘good enough person.’”
Here are two examples of emotional self-disclosure that are fundamental tools of my
therapeutic work. I repeatedly express my genuine indignation that the survivor was taught to
hate himself. Over time, this often awakens the survivor’s instinct to also feel incensed about this
travesty. This then empowers him to begin standing up to the inner critic. This in turn aids him to
emotionally invest in the multidimensional work of building healthy self-advocacy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2179 (Number of characters: 649):
Furthermore, I also repeatedly respond with empathy and compassion to the survivor’s
suffering. With time, this typically helps to awaken the recoveree’s capacity for self-empathy. She then gradually learns to comfort herself when she is in a flashback or otherwise painful life
situation. Less and less often does she surrender to an inner torture of self-hate, self-
disappointment, and self-abandonment. My most consistent feedback from past clients is that responses like these - especially ones
that normalize fear and depression – helped them immeasurably to deconstruct their
perfectionism, and open up to self-compassion and self-acceptance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2180 (Number of characters: 643):
Guidelines For Self-disclosure
What guidelines, then, can we use to insure that our self-disclosure is judicious and therapeutic? I believe the following five principles help me to disclose therapeutically and steer clear of
unconsciously sharing for my own narcissistic gratification. First, I use self-disclosure sparingly. Second, my disclosures are offered primarily to promote a matrix of safety and trust in the
relationship. In this vein my vulnerability is offered to normalize and de-shame the inexorable,
existential imperfection of the human condition, e.g., we all make mistakes, suffer painful
feelings, experience confusion, etc.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2181 (Number of characters: 382):
Third, I do not share vulnerabilities that are currently raw and unintegrated. Fourth, I never disclose in order to work through my own “stuff,” or to meet my own
narcissistic need for verbal ventilation or personal edification. Fifth, while I may share my appreciation or be touched by a client’s attempt or offer to
focus on or soothe my vulnerabilities, I never accept the offer.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2182 (Number of characters: 760):
I gently thank them for their
concern, remind them that our work is client-centered, and let them know that I have an outside

support network. Emotional Self-Disclosure And Sharing Parallel Trauma History Since many of my clients have sought my services after reading my somewhat autobiographical
book on recovery from the dysfunctional family, self-disclosure about my past trauma is
sometimes a moot point. This condition has at the same time helped me realize how powerful
this kind of disclosure can be in healing shame and cultivating hope. Over and over, clients have told me that my vulnerable and pragmatic stories of working
through my parents’ traumatizing abuse and neglect gives them the courage to engage the long
difficult journey of recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2183 (Number of characters: 188):
Now whether or not someone has read my book, I will – with appropriate clients -
judiciously and sparingly share my own experiences of dealing with an issue they have currently
brought up.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2184 (Number of characters: 108):
I do this both to psychoeducate them and to model ways that they might address their
own analogous concerns.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2185 (Number of characters: 60):
One common example sounds like this: “I hate flashbacks too.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2186 (Number of characters: 241):
Even though I get them
much less than when I started this work, falling back into that old fear and shame is so awful.” I also sometimes say: “I really reverberate with your feelings of hopelessness and
powerlessness around the inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2187 (Number of characters: 73):
In the early stages of this work, I often felt
overwhelmingly frustrated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2188 (Number of characters: 58):
It seemed that trying to shrink it actually made it worse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2189 (Number of characters: 352):
But now
after ten thousand repetitions of thought-stopping and thought-correction, my critic is a mere
shadow of its former self.” A final example concerns a purely emotional self-disclosure. When a client is verbally
ventilating about a sorrowful experience, I sometimes allow my tears to brim up in my eyes in
authentic commiseration with their pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2194 (Number of characters: 666):
Such reciprocal interactions prevent either person from polarizing to a dysfunctional narcissistic

Dialogicality energizes both participants in a conversation. Dialogical relating stands in
contrast to the monological energy-theft that characterizes interactions whereby a narcissist
pathologically exploits a codependent’s listening defense. Numerous people have reverberated
with my observation that listening to a narcissist monologue feels as if it is draining them of
energy. I have become so mindful of this dynamic that, in a new social situation, a sudden sense of
tiredness often warns me that I am talking with a narcissist.

I was appalled the other day while perusing a home shopping catalog to see a set of coffee
cups for sale that bore the monikers “Designated Talker” and “Designated Listener”. My wife

those mugs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2198 (Number of characters: 128):
We imagined we could see the narcissists who order them presenting them to their
favorite sounding boards as Christmas presents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2199 (Number of characters: 561):
In therapy, dialogicality develops out of a teamwork approach – a mutual brainstorming
about the client’s issues and concerns. Such an approach cultivates full exploration of
ambivalences, conflicts and other life difficulties. Dialogicality is enhanced when the therapist offers feedback from a take-it-or-leave-it
stance. Dialogicality also implies respectful mutuality. It stands in stark contrast to the blank
screen neutrality and abstinence of traditional psychoanalytic therapy, which all too often
reenacts the verbal and emotional neglect of childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2200 (Number of characters: 474):
I believe abstinence commonly flashes the client back into feelings of abandonment, which
triggers them to retreat into “safe” superficial disclosure, ever-growing muteness and/or early
flight from therapy. Meeting Healthy Narcissistic Needs
All this being said, extensive dialogicality is often inappropriate in the early stages of therapy. This is especially true, when the client’s normal narcissistic needs have never been gratified, and
remain developmentally arrested.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2201 (Number of characters: 52):
In such cases, clients need to be extensively heard.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2202 (Number of characters: 325):
They need to discover through the
agency of spontaneous self-expression the nature of their own feelings, needs, preferences and
views. For those survivors whose self-expression was especially decimated by their caretakers,
self-focused verbal exploration typically needs to be the dominant activity for a great deal of
time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2203 (Number of characters: 90):
Without this, the unformed healthy ego has no room to grow and break free from the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2204 (Number of characters: 549):
The client’s healthy sense of self remains imprisoned beneath the hegemony of the outsized
superego. This does not mean, however, that the client benefits when the therapist retreats into
extremely polarized listening. Most benefit, as early as the first session, from hearing something
real or “personal” from the therapist. This helps overcome the shame-inducing potential that
arises in the “One-seen [client] / One-unseen [therapist]” dynamic. When one person is being
vulnerable and the other is not, shame has a huge universe in which to grow.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2205 (Number of characters: 175):
This also creates a
potential for the client to get stuck flashing back to childhood when the vulnerable child was
rejected over and over by the seemingly invulnerable parent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2206 (Number of characters: 830):
Consequently, many of my colleagues see group therapy as especially powerful for healing
shame, because it rectifies this imbalance by creating a milieu where it is not just one person who
is risking being vulnerable. In this regard, it is interesting to note a large survey of California therapists that occurred
about fifteen years ago. The survey was about their therapy preferences, and upwards of ninety
percent emphasized that they did not want a blank screen therapist, but rather one who
occasionally offered opinions and advice. For twenty-five years, I have been routinely asking clients in the first session: “Based on
your previous experiences in therapy, what would you like to happen in our work together; and
what don’t you want to happen?” How frequently clients respond similarly to the therapists in

the survey!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2207 (Number of characters: 108):
Moreover, the next most common response I receive is that I don’t want a therapist who
does all the talking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2208 (Number of characters: 80):
More than a few have used the exact phrase: “I couldn’t get a word in
edgewise!”

How I wish there was a way that our qualification tests could spot and disqualify the
narcissists who do get licensed and then turn their already codependent clients into sounding

chunk 2210 (Number of characters: 68):
This is the shadowy flipside polarity of the blank screen therapist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2211 (Number of characters: 703):
Psychoeducation As Part Of Dialogicality
Experience has taught me that clients who are childhood trauma survivors typically benefit from
psychoeducation about Complex PTSD. When clients understand the whole picture of Cptsd
recovery, they become more motivated to participate in the self-help practices of recovering. This also increases their overall hopefulness and general engagement in the therapeutic process. I
sometimes wonder whether the rise in the popularity of Coaching has been a reaction to the
various traditional forms of therapeutic neglect. One of the worst forms of therapeutic neglect occurs when the therapist fails to notice or
challenge a client’s incessant, self-hating diatribes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2212 (Number of characters: 94):
This, I believe, is akin to tacitly approving of
and silently colluding with the inner critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2213 (Number of characters: 433):
Perhaps therapeutic withholding and abstinence derives from the absent father syndrome
that afflicts so many Westernized families. Perhaps traditional psychotherapy overemphasizes
the mothering principles of listening and unconditional love, and neglects the fathering principles
of encouragement and guidance that coaching specializes in. Too much coaching is, of course, as counter-therapeutic and unbalanced as too much
listening.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2214 (Number of characters: 101):
It can interfere with the client’s process of self-exploration and self-discovery as
described above.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2215 (Number of characters: 118):
At its worst, it can lure the therapist into the narcissistic trap of falling in love
with the sound of his own voice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2216 (Number of characters: 768):
At its best, coaching is an indispensable therapeutic tool. Just as it takes fathering and
mothering to raise a balanced child, mothering and fathering principles are needed to meet the
developmental arrests of the attachment-deprived client. The sophisticated therapist values both and intuitively oscillates between the two,
depending on the developmental needs of the client in the moment. Sometimes we guide with
psychoeducation, therapeutic self-disclosure and active positive noticing, and most times we
receptively nurture the client’s evolving practice of her own spontaneously arising self-
expression and verbal ventilation. Once again, I believe that in early therapy and many subsequent stages of therapy, the latter
process typically needs to predominate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2217 (Number of characters: 656):
In this vein, I would guess that over the course of most
therapies that I conduct, I listen about ninety percent of the time. Finally, I often notice that the last phase of therapy is often characterized by increasing
dialogicality – a more balanced fluidity of talking and listening. This conversational reciprocity
is a key characteristic of healthy intimacy. Moreover, when therapy is successful, progress in
mutuality begins to serve the client in creating healthier relationships in the outside world. Dialogicality And The 4F’s

Because of childhood abandonment and repetition compulsion in later relationships, many 4F
types are “dying” to be heard.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2218 (Number of characters: 411):
Different types however vary considerably in their dialogical
needs over the course of therapy. The Fawn/ Codependent type, who survived in childhood by becoming a parent’s sounding
board or shoulder to cry on, may use her listening defense to encourage the therapist to do too
much of the talking. With her eliciting defense, she may even invoke the careless therapist into
narcissistically monologing himself.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2219 (Number of characters: 183):
The Freeze/Dissociative type, who learned early to seek safety in the camouflage of silence,
often needs a great deal of encouragement to discover and talk about his inner experience.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2220 (Number of characters: 126):
Psychoeducation can help him understand how his healthy narcissistic need to express himself
was never nurtured in his family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2221 (Number of characters: 150):
Furthermore, freeze types can easily get lost in superficial and barely relevant free
associations as they struggle to learn to talk about themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2222 (Number of characters: 202):
This of course needs to be
welcomed for some time, but eventually we must help him see that his flights of fantasy or
endless dream elaborations are primarily manifestations of his dissociative defense.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2223 (Number of characters: 171):
Freeze types need to learn that emotionally disconnected talking is an old childhood habit
that was developed to keep them buoyant above their undealt with emotional pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2224 (Number of characters: 133):
Because of
this, we must repeatedly guide them toward their feelings so that they can learn to express their
most important concerns.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2225 (Number of characters: 756):
The Fight/Narcissistic type, who often enters therapy habituated to holding court, typically
dodges real intimacy with her talking defense. Therapy can actually be counterproductive for
these types as months or years of uninterrupted monologing in sessions exacerbate their sense of
entitlement. By providing a steady diet of uninterrupted listening, the therapist strengthens their
intimacy-destroying defense of over-controlling conversations. Sooner or later, we must insert
ourselves into the relationship to work on helping them learn to listen. As I write this, I remember Harry from my internship whose tiny capacity to listen to his
wife evaporated as my fifty minutes of uninterrupted listening became his new norm and
expectation in relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2226 (Number of characters: 289):
I felt guilty when I learned this from listening to a recorded message
from his wife about how therapy was making him even more insufferable. I was relieved,
however, a few years later when a different client told me that Harry’s wife eventually felt happy
about this “therapeutic” change.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2227 (Number of characters: 125):
Her husband’s increased self-centeredness was the last straw for
her and she finally, with great relief, shed herself of him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2228 (Number of characters: 203):
A therapist, who is a fawn type herself, may hide in a listening and eliciting defense to avoid the
scary work of gradually insinuating herself into the relationship and nudging it towards
dialogicality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2229 (Number of characters: 71):
If we do not nudge the client to interact, there will be no recovering.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2230 (Number of characters: 73):
For more on
how to approach this, please see the end of the next section.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2231 (Number of characters: 713):
The Flight/Obsessive-compulsive type sometimes presents as being more dialogical than
other types. Like the freeze type, however, he can obsess about “safe” abstract concerns that are
quite removed from his deeper issues. It is therefore up to the therapist to steer him into his
deeper, emotionally based concerns to help him learn a more intimacy-enhancing dialogicality. Otherwise, the flight type can remain stuck and floundering in obsessive perseverations about

superficial worries that are little more than left-brain dissociations from his repressed pain. It is important to note here that all 4F types use left- or right-brain dissociative processes to
avoid feeling and grieving their childhood losses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2232 (Number of characters: 144):
As dialogicality is established, it can then be
oriented toward helping them to uncover and verbally and emotionally vent their ungrieved
hurts.

4. COLLABORATIVE RAPPORT REPAIR
Collaborative rapport repair is the process by which relationships recover and grow closer from
successful conflict resolution.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2234 (Number of characters: 94):
Misattunements and periods of disaffection are existential to every
relationship of substance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2235 (Number of characters: 293):
We all need to learn a process for restoring intimacy when a
disagreement temporarily disrupts our feeling of being safely connected. I believe most people, if they think about it, realize that their best friends are those with
whom they have had a conflict and found a way to work through it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2236 (Number of characters: 144):
Once a friendship survives a
hurtful misattunement, it generally means that it has moved through the fair-weather-friends
stage of relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2237 (Number of characters: 107):
Synchronistic with re-editing this last section, my son uncharacteristically got into a conflict
at school.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2238 (Number of characters: 151):
During third grade recess two of his good friends, also uncharacteristically, started
teasing him, and when they would not stop he pushed each of them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2239 (Number of characters: 412):
This earned them all a trip to
the principal’s office. The principal is a strict but exceptionally wise and kind woman. My son’s
offense, using physical force to resolve a conflict, was judged as the most serious violation of
school policy, but his friends’ were also held responsible for their part and given an enlightening
lecture on teasing. My son, not used to being in trouble, had a good cry about it all.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2240 (Number of characters: 115):
He then agreed that a one
day loss of recess plus writing letters of apology to his friends were fair consequences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2241 (Number of characters: 86):
Two days
later, I asked him how things were going now between him and the two friends.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2242 (Number of characters: 75):
With a look of
surprise and delight, he told me: “It’s really funny, daddy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2243 (Number of characters: 66):
Now, it feels like we’re even better
friends than we were before.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2244 (Number of characters: 330):
Rapport repair is probably the most transformative, intimacy-building process that a therapist can
model. I guide this process from a perspective that recognizes that there is usually a mutual
contribution to any misattunement or conflict. Therefore, a mutually respectful dialogical process
is typically needed to repair rapport.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2245 (Number of characters: 96):
Exceptions to this include scapegoating and upsets that are
instigated by a bullying narcissist.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2246 (Number of characters: 46):
In those situations, they are solely at fault.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2247 (Number of characters: 131):
I have often been
saddened by codependent clients who apologize to their bullying parents as if they made their
parents abuse them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2248 (Number of characters: 101):
In more normal misattunements, I often initiate the repair process with two contiguous
interventions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2249 (Number of characters: 87):
Firstly, I identify the misattunement [e.g., “I think I might have misunderstood
you.”]

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2250 (Number of characters: 114):
And secondly, I then model vulnerability by describing what I think might be my
contribution to the disconnection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2251 (Number of characters: 610):
Abbreviated examples of this are: “I think I may have just been somewhat preachy…or
tired…or inattentive…or impatient…or triggered by my own transference.” Owning your part in

a conflict validates the normality of relational disappointment and the art of amiable resolution. Taking responsibility for your role in a misunderstanding also helps to deconstruct the
client’s outer critic belief that relationships have to be perfect. At the same time, it models a
constructive approach to resolving conflicts, and over time leads most clients to become
interested in exploring their contribution to the conflict.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2252 (Number of characters: 595):
This becomes an invaluable skill which
they can then take into their outside relationships. As one might expect, fight types are the least likely of the 4F’s to collaborate and own their
side of the street in a misattunement. Extreme fight types such as those diagnosed with
Narcissistic Personality Disorder have long been considered untreatable in traditional
psychoanalysis for this reason. With less extreme fight types, I sometimes succeed in psycho-educating them on how they
learned their controlling defenses. From there I try to help them see how much they pay for being
so controlling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2253 (Number of characters: 158):
At the top of the list of debits is intimacy-starvation. Consciously or not, they
hunger for human warmth and they do not get it from those whom they control.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2254 (Number of characters: 102):
Victims of fight
types are too afraid of them to relax enough to generate authentically warm feelings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2255 (Number of characters: 354):
Finally, I believe one of the most common reasons that clients terminate prematurely is the
gradual accumulation of dissatisfactions that they do not feel safe enough to bring up or talk
about. How sad it is that all kinds of promising relationships wither and die from an individual or
couple’s inability to safely work through differences and conflict.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2256 (Number of characters: 103):
Please see Toolbox 4 in
chapter 13 for a list of many pragmatic tools to “Lovingly Resolving Conflict.”

chunk 2257 (Number of characters: 142):
Moving Through Abandonment Into Intimacy: A Case Study
A sweet, freeze-fawn client of mine suffered severe emotional abandonment in childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2258 (Number of characters: 34):
Both
his parents were workaholics.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2259 (Number of characters: 50):
They were, by definition, exceedingly unavailable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2260 (Number of characters: 139):
As the
youngest of five children, Frank always finished last in the sibling competition for the paltry
caretaking his parents had to offer.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2261 (Number of characters: 96):
His adulthood was unfortunately a reenactment of the
relational impoverishment of his childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2262 (Number of characters: 66):
Childhood trauma left Frank hair-triggered to retreat and isolate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2263 (Number of characters: 405):
He had never experienced
an enduring relationship. As a result of our long-term work, however, he became more motivated
to seek a relationship. He successfully dated a healthy and available partner. For the first six
months of their relationship, my coaching and her kind nature enabled him to show more of
himself. He was rewarded by increasing feelings of relaxation and comfort while relating with
her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2264 (Number of characters: 548):
When he accepted her request to move in together, however, it became harder to hide his
recurring emotional flashbacks. He was more convinced than ever that his feelings of fear, shame
and depression were the most despicable of his many fatal flaws. As we worked with this belief in therapy, he remembered many times when even the
mildest dip in his mood triggered his mother to retreat into her home office. He saw that the only
times his mother had a bit of time for him was on those rare occasions when he was buoyant
enough to lift her spirits.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2265 (Number of characters: 91):
He had a staunch conviction that social inclusion depended on him

generating cheerfulness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2266 (Number of characters: 67):
Gloomy and abashed, he confessed: “That’s pretty hard for me, Pete.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2267 (Number of characters: 31):
I’m not much fun to be around.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2268 (Number of characters: 99):
A codependent defense of being perpetually pleasant and agreeable had been deeply
instilled in him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2269 (Number of characters: 117):
He could not shake off the fear that if he was not upbeat enough, his new partner
would be disgusted and abandon him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2270 (Number of characters: 477):
He reported that his flashbacks at home had increased. Sometimes he felt a desperate need to isolate and hide. His freeze response was so activated, that
he increasingly withdrew from his partner into silence. He knew that he was hiding too much in
computer activities, excessive sleeping, and marathon TV sports viewing, but he could not stop. During his most intense flashbacks, his fear and self-disgust became so intense that he
invented any excuse to get out of the house.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2271 (Number of characters: 64):
He was besieged by thoughts and fantasies of being
single again.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2272 (Number of characters: 34):
His critic was winning the battle.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2273 (Number of characters: 80):
He was sure his partner was as disgusted with his
affect as his mother had been.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2274 (Number of characters: 451):
He was on the verge of a literal flight response. He was about to
leave, as he had before when the brief infatuation stages of his few previous relationships ended. We spent many subsequent sessions managing these emotional flashbacks to his original
abandonment. He understood more deeply that his silent withdrawals were evidence that he was
flashing back. He then committed to rereading and using the 13 steps of flashback management
at such times.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2275 (Number of characters: 274):
With my encouragement and gentle nudging, he grieved over his original abandonment
more deeply than ever before. Over and over, he confronted the critic’s projection of his mother
onto his partner. At the same time, I encouraged Frank to be more vulnerable with his partner.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2276 (Number of characters: 46):
He practiced
doing this in role-plays with me.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2277 (Number of characters: 80):
Encouraged by all this work, he began talking to his girlfriend
about his Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2278 (Number of characters: 63):
A good-hearted person, she responded with sympathy and support.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2279 (Number of characters: 419):
This
eventually helped him to disclose that talking vulnerably made him feel even more afraid and
ashamed. To his great relief, she was not only empathic but grateful for his vulnerability. She
told him that his vulnerability made her feel safer to share an even deeper level of her own
vulnerability. He cried poignant tears of gratitude as he told me this. I commiserated with a
welling of sweet tears in my own eyes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2280 (Number of characters: 502):
Frank’s crowning achievement came some months later when he finally felt brave enough
to tell her what he was experiencing while he was actually depressed. This breakthrough further
enriched their intimacy. Their love expanded into those special depths of intimacy that are only
achieved when people feel safe enough to communicate about anything and everything. As my client became more skilled at being vulnerable, he was rewarded with the
irreplaceable intimacy that comes from mutual commiseration.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2281 (Number of characters: 150):
Over the next year, he and his
future wife became such reliable sources of verbal ventilation for each other, that Frank no
longer needed my services.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2282 (Number of characters: 289):
Earned Secure Attachment
In therapy, clients get the most out of their session by learning to stay in interpersonal contact
while they communicate from their emotional pain. This gradually shows them that they are
acceptable and worthwhile no matter what they are feeling and experiencing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2283 (Number of characters: 193):
As survivors realize more deeply that their flashbacks are normal responses to abnormal
childhood conditions, their shame begins to melt. This then eases their fear of being seen as

defective.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2284 (Number of characters: 85):
In turn, their habits of isolating or pushing others away during flashbacks diminish.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2285 (Number of characters: 482):
Earned secure attachment is a newly recognized category of healthy attachment. Many
attachment therapists believe that effective treatment can help a survivor “earn” at least one truly
intimate relationship. Earned secure attachment is the good enough and intimacy-rich attachment
discussed throughout this book. I believe the principles outlined in this chapter are keys to achieving an earned secure
attachment. In this vein, good therapy can be an intimacy-modeling relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2286 (Number of characters: 509):
It fosters our
leaning and practicing of intimacy-making behavior. Your connection with your therapist can
become a transitional earned secure attachment. This in turn can lead to the attainment of an
earned secure attachment outside of therapy. I have repeatedly seen this result with my most
successful clients, and I am grateful to report that my last experience with my own therapy lead
me to this reward. Rescuing The Survivor From The Critic
I will conclude this section with a final note to therapists.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2287 (Number of characters: 576):
The term rescuing and what it
represents has become taboo in many psychotherapy circles and in the 12-Step Movement (e.g.
AA, CODA and ACA). The word “rescuing” is often used in such an all-or-none way that any
type of active helping is pathologized. However, I believe that helping survivors out of the abyss
of emotional flashbacks is a necessary form of rescuing. A key place to practice healthy rescuing is in the realm of the critic. I believe there is an
unmet childhood need for rescue that I help meet when I “save” my client from the critic, the
proxy of her parents.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2288 (Number of characters: 28):
This is the need no one met.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2289 (Number of characters: 219):
The child was not rescued from her
traumatizing parent. This was terrible neglect on the part of the other parent, the relatives, the
neighbors or teachers who ignored the signs that she was withering from being abused.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2290 (Number of characters: 141):
Decades of trauma work have taken me to a place where my heart no longer allows me to
be silent when someone’s inner critic is on the attack.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2291 (Number of characters: 53):
Silence, in my mind, is equivalent to tacit
approval.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2292 (Number of characters: 374):
I can no longer sit quietly and not intervene when survivors abuse themselves with
their parents’ internalized voice. I am additionally motivated to challenge the client’s toxic critic because of the failure of my
first long-term experience of psychoanalytic therapy. My “blank screen” therapist let me
flounder endlessly in attacking myself with self-hate and self-disgust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2293 (Number of characters: 87):
Never once did she point
out that I could and should challenge this anti-self behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2294 (Number of characters: 110):
UCSF trauma expert Harvey Peskin
would call this a failure to bear witness to the traumatization of the child.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2295 (Number of characters: 496):
I now vocally challenge the critic’s lies and slanders, and I try to give the survivor a hand to
climb out of the abyss of fear and shame into which the critic has pushed him. It took me some time to break through the dysfunctional guilt that my early training
instilled in me about rescuing. Now, ironically, when I feel guilty, it is sometimes because I have
regressed and let the inner critic get away with abusing my friend or my client. This guilt is
actually healthy emotional intelligence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2296 (Number of characters: 72):
It comes from my empathy as a right action-call to
challenge the critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2297 (Number of characters: 648):
At such times, I feel derelict in my human and professional duty if I do not

bring attention to how he is hoisting himself on his parents’ petard. Gratefully, I can no longer passively collude with the internalized critical parent by failing
to actively notice it like all those other adults did while he was growing up. If an adult does not
protest when a child is being attacked with destructive criticism, she is in an unspoken alliance
with the critic. The child is forced to assume contempt is normal and acceptable. The witnessing
adult has forsaken her/his tribal responsibility to protect the child from parents who perpetrate
child abuse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2298 (Number of characters: 278):
When I label the traumatizing behavior of the client’s parents as contemptible, I begin the
awakening of his developmentally arrested need for self-protection. I model to him that he
should have been protected, and that he can now resist mimicking their abuse in his own psyche.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2299 (Number of characters: 431):
With most of my clients, this eventually encourages disidentification from the aggressor and
weakens the internalization of the attacking parent as the locus of the critic. In my own case, I felt loved by my grandmother who lived with my family, but she failed to
help me see that my parents’ vitriolic rages were wrong and not my fault. In retrospect, I believe
that her neglect crystallized my belief that I deserved their abuse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2300 (Number of characters: 73):
The stage was then set for me
to morph their contempt into self-loathing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2301 (Number of characters: 52):
I did this chapter and verse for nearly two decades.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2302 (Number of characters: 155):
I have also noticed a significant difference in survivors who were helped in childhood to see that
it was not their fault that they were being traumatized.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2303 (Number of characters: 155):
When there was one witnessing adult who
sufficiently decried what was being done to them, most did not develop such a ferocious, self-
annihilating critic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2304 (Number of characters: 110):
Typically this was the other parent, an enlightened older sibling, a relative, a
teacher or a kindly neighbor.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2305 (Number of characters: 188):
FINDING A THERAPIST
I have as yet to do any therapist trainings in my approach outside of the San Francisco Bay Area,
so I cannot make any recommendations for therapists outside this area.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2306 (Number of characters: 196):
However, because my
approach is compatible with that of John Bradshaw’s, I refer people to a website that lists
therapists around the U. S. and the World who report that they embrace his approach.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2307 (Number of characters: 198):
The link to
this is www.creativegrowth.com/referral.htm. I and the Creative Growth Center are however unable to personally endorse these therapists
as we are not personally familiar with their work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2308 (Number of characters: 639):
Nonetheless, I think this is a good place to
start. Please begin by first reading the following recommendations for interviewing a therapist. The purpose of the interview is to ascertain whether your potential therapist is able and
willing to work at the levels I describe above. I recommend interviewing and having a trial
appointment with at least three therapists, if possible, to determine if their approach is
compatible enough with the one I describe above. A suitable therapist will be happy to answer your question about their approach and
generally talk with you on the phone for at least five minutes before scheduling a meeting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2309 (Number of characters: 670):
Should the therapist respond to you in an aloof, critical or shaming way, I would immediately

cross them off your list and keep looking. Finally, it is important to note that there are many untherapized therapists who are licensed
to practice psychotherapy, and my experience is that these types are rarely able to work at the
depth required for guiding Cptsd recovery. I believe it’s appropriate to ask a prospective therapist if they have done their own therapy. I would then at least expect from him/her a response that they have and have found it helpful. Ideally, the therapist would also be willing to disclose that they have done their own family of
origin work.

chunk 2313 (Number of characters: 412):
If you live in a reasonable sized city and persevere, I think your
chances of finding a “good enough” therapist are good. Finding An Online Or Live Support Group If you cannot afford or find helpful enough therapy, there are many types of self-help groups that
are free and powerfully therapeutic. Moreover, if you are in therapy, your recovery process may
be enhanced by using any of the resources that follows.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2314 (Number of characters: 757):
Here are some websites that have been
repeatedly recommended to me:
www.outofthefog.org
www.ptsdforum.org
www.coda.org is the URL for Codependents Anonymous, one of my favorites, which can
be especially helpful for anyone who is a fawn type or subtype.
www.ascasupport.org for survivors of childhood abuse in general. www.adultchildren.org provides support for ACA’s – Adult Children of Alcoholics. www.siawso.org is a helpful site for survivors of incest. www.standagainstdv.org is a site for those survivors whose childhood abuse has lead them
to become victims of domestic violence. www.nobully.com is a very helpful website for survivors who, because of bad luck or
repetition compulsion, are stuck in a job or relationship where they are being bullied.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2315 (Number of characters: 233):
www.daughtersofnarcissisticmothers.com
www.narcissisticmother.org these last two are for recovering from being raised by a
narcissistic mother
Several of these sites also have listings of live meetings that can be attended in person.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2316 (Number of characters: 156):
The
Creative Growth Center mentioned at the beginning of the last section also offers groups for
recovering from shame and grieving the losses of childhood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2317 (Number of characters: 32):
They are located in Berkeley CA.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2318 (Number of characters: 159):
Finally, if none of these recommendations seem suitable, Googling “online support groups
for recovering from childhood trauma” brings up a plethora of results.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2319 (Number of characters: 808):
An important guideline for finding a safe enough online or in-person group: If you find that a
leader or member is over-dominating a group through narcissistic behaviors such as monologing,
monopolizing the time, pressuring anyone with unwanted advice or shaming anyone in anyway,
please allow yourself to leave and try another group. CO-COUNSELING
If you are not able to find or afford a “good enough” therapist, and/or if you want to supplement
your current therapy as my wife and I do regularly with each other, you can look for a safe
partner who is willing to work with you to mutually evolve a co-counseling relationship. There are many forms of co-counseling. {Google “co-counseling” to learn more.} My wife and I have a simple structure for establishing a safe and healing co-counseling
relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2320 (Number of characters: 78):
We have been using this model for many years and derive great benefit from it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2321 (Number of characters: 86):
I
have similarly benefitted from co-counseling with two wonderful friends in the past.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2322 (Number of characters: 91):
Please feel
free, of course to adapt the model to fit your own mutual needs and agreements.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2323 (Number of characters: 50):
Meet weekly and exchange 30 or 60 minute sessions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2324 (Number of characters: 163):
Begin with the counselee talking about all and any of his/her concerns and with the
counselor refraining from intervening other than to practice, Active Listening.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2325 (Number of characters: 76):
Active listening is based on an attitude of “unconditional positive regard”.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2326 (Number of characters: 520):
It enhances the
counselee’s process of full verbal ventilation, and it uses non-directive, non-intrusive verbal
feedback to let the counselee know that you are attuned and paying attention to him/her. Active listening includes responses like “un hunh” and “mmm-hmmm” as well as a
technique known as mirroring. Mirroring occurs when we repeat key words or phrases that the
other person says to let them know that we are paying attention to them. Advanced mirroring occurs when we paraphrase in our own words what we hear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2327 (Number of characters: 84):
This is
only helpful however if we make an accurate translation of what’s been said.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2328 (Number of characters: 252):
Finally, the use of open-ended questions is perhaps the penultimate active listening
techniques. Questions such as “Can you tell me more about that?”, “What else happened?”, and
“Do you have other thoughts and feelings about that?” can be very helpful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2329 (Number of characters: 122):
Opened ended questions stand in contrast to pointed questions which tend to limit or shape
the way the counselee responds.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2330 (Number of characters: 192):
“What do you think or feel about that?” allows the other person
greater internal exploration than “Did you feel upset about that?” which may be perceived as a
statement rather than a question.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2331 (Number of characters: 67):
It can sound like you are telling them what they should be
feeling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2332 (Number of characters: 64):
People vary in the amount of active listening they find helpful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2333 (Number of characters: 98):
Please be open to giving and
receiving feedback about how much you or the other person would like.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2334 (Number of characters: 789):
In order to establish safety and build trust, begin with a commitment to refrain from advice

giving, criticism or any kind of unsolicited feedback except active listening. If and when the
desire for feedback comes up, it is best to let the counselee determine when, what kind and how
much they want. Feedback is best given from a take-it or leave-it perspective
Do not give any feedback unless it is clearly asked for. The counselee often does well to be
specific about the type of feedback desired, or the desire to not have any feedback; e.g., “I’d like
to just verbally ventilate about my relationship, but don’t really want any feedback about it other
than active listening.” At another point the counselee might like to say: “This is something I
would actually like some feedback on.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2335 (Number of characters: 71):
I’d like to know whether it seems that I’m perceiving my
boss clearly.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2336 (Number of characters: 209):
With enough grace, luck, respect, practice and compassion, mutual trust may eventually
come so far that you both agree to change the structure to allow for spontaneous feedback at
certain times in the session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2337 (Number of characters: 153):
Don’t rush to get there, and always reserve permission to invoke the
no-feedback guideline for any given issue, session or indefinite number of sessions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2338 (Number of characters: 98):
In this vein, my wife or I might say to each other: “I think I’d just like active listening
today.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2339 (Number of characters: 128):
I’d like to just extensively free associate on and explore this anxious feeling in my chest

chunk 2342 (Number of characters: 656):
I also recommend that both partners read Toolbox 4 in chapter 13, and the section above on
the four key qualities of relational healing prior to commencing a co-counseling relationship. FORGIVENESS: BEGIN WITH THE SELF
This chapter is a reworking of an article of mine that was published in Recovering, November
1991. I wrote it because I was appalled at how much pressure my clients were getting to just
forgive and forget. Consequently, many of them were diving right back into denial, and
minimizing all the trauma that they had endured. Their recovery processes then, screeched to a
halt as their inner critics denigrated them for being so unforgiving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2343 (Number of characters: 767):
Because this article was helpful to my clients and because I received so much positive
feedback from the recovery community, I was motivated to write my first book, The Tao of Fully
Feeling, Harvesting Forgiveness Out of Blame. This book explores the complex subject of
forgiving past abusers in considerable depth. In this vein, it asserts that some parents were so
destructive to us, that they are not forgivable. There is a lot of shaming, dangerous and inaccurate “guidance” put out about forgiveness in both
the recovery community and in many spiritual teachings. Many survivors of dysfunctional
families have been injured by the simplistic, black-and-white advice that they must embrace a
position of being totally and permanently forgiving in order to recover.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2344 (Number of characters: 481):
Unfortunately, those who take the advice to forgive abuses that they have not fully grieved,
abuses that are still occurring, and/or abuses so heinous they should and could never be forgiven,
often find themselves getting nowhere in their recovery process. In fact, the possibility of attaining real feelings of forgiveness is usually lost when there is a
premature, cognitive decision to forgive. This is because premature forgiveness mimics the
defenses of denial and repression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2345 (Number of characters: 88):
It keeps unprocessed feelings of anger and hurt about
childhood trauma out of awareness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2346 (Number of characters: 747):
Real forgiveness is quite distinct from premature forgiveness. It is almost always a byproduct of
effective grieving and no amount of thought, intention or belief can bring it into being without a
great deal of emotional work. Conversely, belief systems that are not open to the possibility of forgiveness sometimes
block our access to forgiving feelings, even when such feelings are present. It might be that the healthiest cognitive position concerning forgiveness is an attitude that
allows for the possibility of its occurrence on the other side of extensive grieving. This attitude
works best if it includes the condition that feelings of forgiveness will not be forced or falsely
invoked to cover up any unresolved feelings of hurt or anger.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2347 (Number of characters: 153):
In this vein, it is crucial to understand that certain types of abuse are so extreme and
damaging to the victim that forgiveness is simply not an option.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2348 (Number of characters: 364):
Examples of this include
sociopathy, conscious cruelty, and many forms of scapegoating and parental incest. When forgiveness has substance, it is felt palpably in the heart, and is usually an expansion of
the emotion of compassion. Compassion is certainly not always the same thing as forgiveness,
but it is usually the experience within which forgiveness is born.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2349 (Number of characters: 251):
Often this happens via an
intermediate process, where having grieved our childhood losses substantially, we occasionally
find ourselves considering the extenuating circumstances that contributed to our parents raising
us in neglectful or abusive ways.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2350 (Number of characters: 731):
Most commonly these extenuating circumstances revolve around two issues. First, our
parents often parented us in ways that blindly replicated the ways that they were parented. And
second, they were often supported in their dysfunctional parenting by the social norms and
values of their times. Nonetheless, it is once again vitally important that we do not jump into considering their
mitigating circumstances until we have significantly worked through the traumatic consequences
that their abuse and abandonment had on us. When considering our parents extenuating circumstances, we may sometimes “get” that our
parents were also quite victimized, and we may consequently find ourselves on occasion feeling
sorry (sorrow) for them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2351 (Number of characters: 652):
Sometimes this experience of feeling compassion for them becomes profound enough for us
to comprehend how similarly awful and unfair their childhoods were. This feeling-based
realization may on occasion morph into feeling some forgiveness for them. However, unless this feeling of forgiveness for our parents is grounded in compassion for
ourselves, the above process is an empty mental exercise. Even worse, it may become a great
hindrance to doing the fundamental angering work of real recovery. Premature forgiveness will prohibit us from showing the inner child that she had the right to
be angry about her parents’ cold-hearted abandonment of her.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2352 (Number of characters: 195):
It will stop us from helping her to
express and release those old angry feelings. Premature forgiveness will also inhibit the survivor from reconnecting with his instinctual

self-protectiveness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2353 (Number of characters: 95):
He may never learn that he can now use his anger, if necessary, to stop
present day unfairness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2354 (Number of characters: 88):
As real forgiveness is primarily a feeling, it is - like all other feelings - ephemeral.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2355 (Number of characters: 61):
It is
never complete, never permanent, and never a done deal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2356 (Number of characters: 613):
Forgiveness is governed by the dynamic nature of all human feeling experience. Our
emotional experience is a frequently changing, unchoosable and unpredictable process of the
psyche. No emotional state can be induced to persist as a permanent experience. As sad as this may
be, as much as we might like to deny it, as much as it continuingly frustrates us, and as much as
we are pressured to control and pick our emotions, they are still by definition of the human
condition, largely outside the province of our wills. Forgiveness then, like love, remains a human feeling experience that is only temporarily ours.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2357 (Number of characters: 791):
However, when we thoroughly vent our angry feelings about the past, feelings of forgiveness
become more accessible. When we learn how to grieve ourselves out of abandonment
flashbacks, we reemerge into a feeling of belonging to and loving the world. Moreover, when we learn to effectively grieve through present day hurts, we quite naturally
move back into loving feelings. As our emotional flexibility matures, lost feelings of love and
forgiveness return so reliably that they can become consciously chosen values. Thus, when I occasionally feel hurt by proven intimates, I may not be able to immediately
invoke loving or forgiving feelings towards them, but I know that with sufficient communication
and non-abusive venting, I will eventually return to an appreciative experience of them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2358 (Number of characters: 159):
As much as I can forgive myself, that much can I forgive others. What I often forgive in others is
an old pain of mine, released from the disgust of self-hate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2359 (Number of characters: 94):
It is an old vulnerability of mine that I
now love and welcome like a bird with a broken wing.

It would appear as if the art of loving is not whether you love or not (we all do in our

We humans are instruments for love by design.

(So is the whole universe!) When love blows across us,
naturally we sing a love song. And when there is no love wind to blow,
though it leaves us strange
and willow-like,
love has gone to an empty field where it fills its
wind sails again
so that it might return
and blow across our all too hungering instruments
one more time.

What shall we do while we wait?

tenderly and compassionately

until we remember,
“Love always returns.”

BIBLIOTHERAPY AND THE COMMUNITY OF BOOKS
Bibliotherapy is a term that describes the very real process of being positively and
therapeutically influenced by what you read. As stated earlier, when it is at its most powerful,
bibliotherapy is also relationally healing. It can rescue you from the common Cptsd feeling of
abject isolation and alienation. Bibliotherapy can play an enormous role in enhancing recovery from Cptsd.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2372 (Number of characters: 487):
I usually find
that my clients who make the most progress are those who augment their therapy sessions with
reading homework [self-prescribed or recommended by me]. This is especially true of those who further augment their reading with journaling about
their cognitive and emotional responses to what they have read. I believe that journaling helps
build the new physiological and neuronal brain circuitry that occurs as we effectively meet our
developmentally arrested childhood needs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2373 (Number of characters: 99):
[For more on Journaltherapy, read the section on
verbal ventilating in chapter 5 of my first book].

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2374 (Number of characters: 179):
Bibliotherapy is especially helpful for people like me who grew up in dangerous social
environments replete with adults who offered little but criticism, intimidation and disgust.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2375 (Number of characters: 649):
It
equally serves those whose early lives were devoid of adults who could be looked to for safe
support and guidance. It was not until later in life, after I had quite a few years of group and individual therapy,
that I realized that my journey of recovering had actually begun decades before my formal
therapy. It began with all the therapeutic reading and writing I had instinctively gravitated to. I
unconsciously sought the help of others in the many spiritual and psychological self-help books
that I was intuitively drawn to. Without really understanding it, I gained valuable insights about how to improve the way I
treated myself and others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2376 (Number of characters: 591):
Just as importantly, I subliminally realized that there were a number of
good, safe, wise and helpful adults out there who could be trusted and who had a great deal of
wise and kind guidance to offer. I remember my first deeply emotional experience of entering the community of books. I was
in the library resentfully slogging through the poetry section trying to find a book for my
homework in high school English. I was up to “W “and had found nothing that remotely interested me when I came to an
anthology with the picture of a very compelling looking old man on its cover. Walt Whitman!

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2377 (Number of characters: 305):
His epic poems Song of Myself and Song of the Open Road thrilled me and changed my life. He
became my hero and the first adult role model that had something useful and important to teach
me. His ideas became my raison d’être and gave me a hopeful plan for what I would do when I
finally escaped my family.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2378 (Number of characters: 416):
Over time the authors in my community of books seemed like a small tribe of elders who I
imagined as people who would have empathy for me if I were to meet them. Eventually when I
achieved something of a critical mass of this awareness, I managed to take a frightening leap into
the water of therapy. I lucked out and got a good enough therapist to help me take steps in my
healing that I could not manage on my own.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2379 (Number of characters: 96):
So here are some authors [and their works] who have been especially helpful to me on my

SELF-HELP TOOLS
This chapter is composed of six toolboxes, each with a set of tools to address different recovery
issues. Nonetheless, I still value these lists as indispensable adjuncts to my own journey of
recovering. I often hand out these lists to clients at appropriate times in their journey.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2387 (Number of characters: 463):
I also give
them to students who attend my classes. I have received a great deal of positive feedback about
how helpful they have been to enhancing recovery. My friends and clients whose recovery progresses at the greatest rate are those who
supplement their therapy with self-help activities. Those who print out these lists, and carry them
around or post them in a conspicuous place until they are deeply ingrained seem to take a
quantum leap in their recovery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2388 (Number of characters: 141):
I hope that you become immersed in these lists, and that they give you the healing support
that I have seen so many others receive from them.

Conclusion
In conclusion, you progress in recovering from the multidimensional wounding of Cptsd:

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2401 (Number of characters: 417):
[1] as increasing mindfulness decreases your unconscious 4F acting out, [2] as your critic shrinks, [3] as your brain becomes more user-friendly, [4] as grieving your childhood losses builds your emotional intelligence,
[5] as your body relaxes and your mind becomes more peaceful, [5] as your healthy ego matures into a healthy sense of self,
[6] as your life narrative becomes self-compassionate and self-affirming,

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2402 (Number of characters: 81):
[7] as your emotional vulnerability creates authentic experiences of intimacy and

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2403 (Number of characters: 52):
[8] as a you attain “good enough” safe relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2404 (Number of characters: 81):
And let me reemphasize once again that recovery is not an all-or-none phenomenon.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2405 (Number of characters: 157):
It is a
gradual process marked by ongoing growth in any of these arenas, and most especially in a
decreasing frequency, intensity and duration of flashbacks.

I hope and pray that much sooner than later you will experience an increasing access to the silver

be to feel that you safely belong to the world.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2408 (Number of characters: 207):

emotional intelligence will bring you at least one intimate relationship where you can ongoingly

TOOLS FOR LOVINGLY
RESOLVING CONFLICT
This is a list of techniques and perspectives I’ve gathered over the years to help couples resolve
conflict as lovingly as possible. When I give it to couples that I work with, I ask them to take
time at home to read it aloud together and to discuss each one as much as necessary to see if they
can agree to adopt it as a guideline for handling conflict. When I first got together with my wife eleven years ago, we spent considerable time on a
weekend trip discussing these guidelines one at a time. We aired our concerns, enthusiasms,
caveats and reservations about using them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2560 (Number of characters: 251):

More on Timeouts, #16
Two of the most common reasons that relationships break up is irreconcilable differences and
irreparable damages. The latter could have been prevented in many cases if couples knew how to
use timeouts judiciously. This is especially true for fight-type trauma survivors, who when flashing back, can easily
lose control to the outer critic and say intimacy-destroying things. Survivors benefit greatly from
learning to recognize the signs of being over-activated so that they can then take timeouts to stop
the bleeding caused by a critic on the rampage.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2604 (Number of characters: 794):
Things said in the heat of a flashback can wound deeply and engrave themselves in the
psyche of the other in ways that cripple trust. So much of this needless intimacy-destruction will
be prevented if both members of the couple agree that either of them can call a timeout whenever
they feel too triggered to be lovingly confrontive, or are experiencing the other as flashing back
into being overly aggressive. Timeouts can range from one minute to 24 hours depending on how long it takes either or
both partners to achieve good enough flashback management. Timeouts work best when the person calling them nominates a time to resume conflict
resolution, so that timeouts do not become techniques for dodging issues. Timeouts can be used individually as a time to release any accumulated charge.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2605 (Number of characters: 122):
This can be

More on Transference, #19 & #20 In using this list with couples, I notice that those who are most skilled in conflict resolution, have
achieved significant skill with steps 19 through 21. These steps are about learning to handle
transference. For trauma survivors, transference is often a type of flashback whereby we unconsciously
react to our significant others as though they were our childhood caretakers. When this occurs,

we displace onto them a great deal of our unresolved childhood emotional pain.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2608 (Number of characters: 367):
One common example of this occurs when a partner’s fair and minor complaint triggers a
torrent of rage, fear and/or shame that is left over from decades of a parent’s overwhelming and
rejecting criticism. Another instance of this occurs when her failure to say what he was hoping to hear stirs up
the pain of decades of his aloof, detached mother or father’s neglect.

Hendrix’s
Getting The Love You Want, is a wonderful guide for working through this dynamic in a

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2612 (Number of characters: 445):
In my experience, the vast majority of conflicts between consenting adults involve a
dynamic where both people play a part and have some responsibility for a disruption in their
loving connection. Truly healing resolutions to conflict typically occur when each partner owns their part and
expresses an apology about their contribution to the conflict. For deep level resolution this
usually includes an apologetic reference to your transference.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2613 (Number of characters: 125):
A good apology sounds something
like this of this: “I’m sorry for the amount of charge I had in expressing my disappointment.
