Module 2: Using Supervision
OBJECTIVES 
• To discuss the importance of supervision/consultation in CBT training 
• To provide information on how to use clinical supervision and consultation  
in CBT training 
• To outline various models of supervision/consultation in CBT training 
• To provide tips on selecting a supervisor/consultant 
Introduction
Knowledge about psychotherapy can be broken down into two broad domains, 1) 
knowledge of concepts and 2) knowledge of how to apply concepts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 2 (Number of characters: 169):
Information 
contained in this manual will provide you with basic knowledge of CBT concepts and 
attempt to provide you with practical tips on how to use these concepts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 3 (Number of characters: 205):
However, 
because the provision of CBT is highly variable, depending on the provider, patient, and 
treatment setting, applications of CBT will need to be customized and practiced in real- 
world settings.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 4 (Number of characters: 69):
This manual is, therefore, only the first step toward CBT competency.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 5 (Number of characters: 1233):
Supervision and consultation are two methods to advance CBT practice skills through 
routine feedback and interaction with a knowledgeable CBT provider who can serve as a 
trainer/consultant. What is Supervision, and Why Is It Important to CBT? Supervision is designed to a) foster the supervisee's development and b) ensure patient 
welfare and safety by monitoring patient care. Supervision is NOT therapy; although 
supervision may involve an exploration of a provider’s personal experiences, such a focus 
is restricted to issues that influence the provider’s professional work (see following table.) Table 2.1 Goals and Focus of Supervision
 
ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 2
For the 
Supervisee
• Provides provider performance feedback
• Provides guidance and acquisition of alternative viewpoints
• Contributes to the process of forming a provider’s identity
• Serves as a secure base to explore applications and 
therapeutic principles
For the 
Patient
• Ensures that patients receive acceptable care
 » Providers do no harm
 » Providers possess sufficient skills
 » Those who lack skills are provided with remediation

SUPERVISION VERSUS CONSULTATION
There is a difference between supervision and consultation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 6 (Number of characters: 436):
Whereas supervision 
involves the direct oversight of clinical cases over a period of time (often involving 
evaluation of the provider), consultation refers to a relationship designed to assist in 
professional development that does not involve formal oversight of clinical cases and 
may or may not continue over time. In essence, consultation involves a growth-oriented 
discussion of cases or issues without oversight or evaluation.

When?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 8 (Number of characters: 31):
(Indications/Contraindications)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 9 (Number of characters: 173):
Ideally, supervision or consultation occurs on a regular basis. Typically, for providers 
learning CBT, supervision/consultation should occur every week or every other week.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 10 (Number of characters: 128):
Monthly consultation meetings may be appropriate for licensed practitioners in a 
more advanced stage of psychotherapy training.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 11 (Number of characters: 229):
Supervision and/or consultation may 
also augment workshop-based training, with the workshop building initial skills and 
consultation/supervision helping the provider to deliver high-quality care during real-
world applications.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 14 (Number of characters: 69):
The following table outlines the most common formats for supervision.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 15 (Number of characters: 145):
The usefulness of 
each procedure will be determined by the goals of supervision and the supervisee’s level 
of training and developmental needs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 16 (Number of characters: 68):
Exposure to multiple training modalities is seen as 
most effective.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 31 (Number of characters: 234):
Availability
• For those first learning how to apply CBT, it is highly recommended that you identify 
supervisors/consultants who are available for weekly or bi-weekly meetings that 
involve anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes per meeting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 32 (Number of characters: 87):
The actual length of meetings 
can be determined by the number of cases being reviewed.

ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 3
Module 3: Therapeutic Skills in Brief CBT
OBJECTIVES
• To better understand the need for a strong therapeutic relationship in brief CBT 
• To understand the factors associated with a strong therapeutic relationship
• To learn strategies for developing rapport and maximizing nonspecific factors 
What are Therapeutic Skills, and Why Are They Important to CBT?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 46 (Number of characters: 36):
CBT is structured and goal-directed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 47 (Number of characters: 98):
The context is supportive, and the techniques are 
paired with a collaborative therapeutic stance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 48 (Number of characters: 697):
Therapeutic skills refer to the relationship 
components of therapy (e.g., rapport, installation of hope, trust, collaboration) and 
are comparable with treatment-specific skills that refer to the technical aspects of the 
psychotherapy orientation (e.g., the actual techniques such as guided imagery, thought 
challenging, etc.). Therapeutic skills are common within all psychotherapies and serve as 
the foundation for patient improvement. Refer to intervention techniques unique to the 
type of therapy being provided (e.g., CBT, psychodynamic, interpersonal). Studies show 
that therapeutic skills are responsible for a large percentage of the change associated with 
psychotherapy treatments.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 49 (Number of characters: 5):
When?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 50 (Number of characters: 31):
(Indications/Contraindications)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 51 (Number of characters: 240):
Therapeutic skills are critical during the early stages and important at all phases 
of treatment. Strong therapeutic skills aid in engaging and retaining patients in 
psychotherapy and also strengthen the technical components of treatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 52 (Number of characters: 412):
Patients who 
perceive the therapeutic relationship to be collaborative, safe, and trusting are in a better 
position to obtain benefit from the treatment, will likely be less resistant and more open 
to exploration and change. As treatment progresses, the therapeutic relationship should 
become stronger, allowing the provider and patient to gradually move into more complex 
and meaningful therapeutic issues.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 53 (Number of characters: 4):
How?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 54 (Number of characters: 180):
(Instructions/Handouts)
Borrowing from person-centered therapy, this module focuses on four factors (Figure 
3.1) important to the development of a strong therapeutic relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 55 (Number of characters: 61):
These factors are 
empathy, genuineness, and positive regard.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 56 (Number of characters: 138):
These concepts are defined and discussed and 
represent general characteristics that all providers should attain in working with patients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 57 (Number of characters: 141):
Following a discussion of these principles, active listening is introduced as a technique to 
better attain a solid therapeutic relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 58 (Number of characters: 268):
EMPATHY (VALIDATING THE PATIENT'S EXPERIENCE) Empathy is the ability to understand experiences from another person’s point of view. Empathy is an important part of building rapport and facilitates feelings of trust and 
mutual respect between the patient and provider.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 59 (Number of characters: 93):
It is impossible for a provider to be 
knowledgeable about every patient's unique background.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 60 (Number of characters: 237):
Empathy, which at its core 

18
consists of asking questions in a respectfully curious manner and expressing 
emotional understanding of the answers received, is a solid first step towards 
understanding patients' unique life background.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 61 (Number of characters: 171):
Additional reading about cultural 
differences may facilitate more informed questions and better prepare the provider for 
additional questions and/or rapport development.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 62 (Number of characters: 64):
Showing empathy to patients helps to validate their experiences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 63 (Number of characters: 149):
Being critical, even 
subtly, of what patients are sharing in therapy often makes them feel judged and unwilling 
to disclose additional information.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 64 (Number of characters: 282):
Use validating responses to show empathy towards a 
patient. Validating responses are simply statements of understanding of your patient’s 
viewpoint. Validating responses usually entails the provider’s describing what the provider 
heard the patient say, in a nonjudgmental manner.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 65 (Number of characters: 143):
Figure 3.1 Developing a Strong Therapeutic Relationship 
GENUINENESS
Genuineness is the ability to be authentic and free of deceit or judgment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 66 (Number of characters: 66):
You can be 
professional and express who you are at the same time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 67 (Number of characters: 250):
Genuineness helps build rapport 
and solidify a therapeutic relationship by allowing the patient to view the provider as a 
human being. Patients often assess the genuineness of the provider for credible feedback 
about progress in their functioning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 68 (Number of characters: 178):
ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 3 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      

19
Genuineness consists of a wide variety of concepts ranging from nonverbal 
behaviors to overt statements.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 69 (Number of characters: 343):
Examples of factors related to genuineness include: 
Supporting nonverbal behavior: Providers should be aware of their own nonverbal 
behaviors like keeping eye contact, giving a patient your full attention like substitute 
such as for like keeping eye contact, giving a patient your full attention, and nodding in 
agreement or understanding.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 70 (Number of characters: 134):
It’s important that these nonverbal behaviors match what 
is going on in the conversation, so as not to seem unnatural or inauthentic.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 71 (Number of characters: 167):
Role behavior: CBT providers encourage patients to be active and empowered and 
subsequently attempt to facilitate this development through their behaviors in therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 72 (Number of characters: 129):
Providers that stress their authority in and between sessions with patients can cause a 
patient to feel inferior or intimidated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 73 (Number of characters: 194):
It is important to remember that the therapeutic 
relationship is one of partnership and the provider and patient work together to alleviate 
concerns, fears, and problems in the patient’s life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 74 (Number of characters: 11):
Congruence:

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 75 (Number of characters: 109):
Making sure that your words, nonverbal behavior, and feelings match each 
other is referred to as congruence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 76 (Number of characters: 108):
Not demonstrating congruence of your feelings and 
thoughts can become confusing or misleading to a patient.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 77 (Number of characters: 98):
Spontaneity: This concept deals with the way the provider speaks and the timeliness 
of responses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 78 (Number of characters: 106):
Responses and feedback provided "in the moment" are more valuable 
than feedback provided at a later time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 79 (Number of characters: 69):
Patients are more likely to receive spontaneous 
messages as genuine.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 80 (Number of characters: 91):
POSITIVE REGARD
Positive regard simply means showing all patients the respect they deserve.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 81 (Number of characters: 98):
It’s essential 
to show patients that they are valued and that what they have to say is important.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 82 (Number of characters: 170):
Patients 
who feel that their thoughts and feelings are acknowledged and understood often share 
more and feel more connected to the provider and the therapeutic process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 83 (Number of characters: 359):
Communicating positive regard may be harder than it seems, especially if you hold some 
negative beliefs about the person you are trying to help. Sharing any negative feelings or 
beliefs about your patients with your supervisor or consultant can be an excellent method 
to ensure that you develop and demonstrate genuine positive regard toward your patients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 84 (Number of characters: 129):
Commitment to the patient means that you are dedicated to working with patients 
on whatever issues they are bringing to therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 85 (Number of characters: 139):
This includes being on time, avoiding 
canceling patients’ appointments, and using all efforts to help patients work through 
these issues.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 86 (Number of characters: 105):
Having a nonjudgmental attitude towards the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the 
patient is essential.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 87 (Number of characters: 92):
It is possible to accept and understand a perspective without 
necessarily agreeing with it.

ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 3
Displaying warmth towards patients is a vital part of building rapport.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 89 (Number of characters: 126):
Warmth can be displayed through tone of voice, facial expressions and body 
postures, or the thoughtfulness of your responses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 90 (Number of characters: 283):
The following section addresses the concept of active listening. Active listening is a 
useful technique to communicate the nonspecific factors of empathy, genuineness, and 
positive regard. ACTIVE LISTENING
Listening to your patients is the foundation of all therapeutic approaches.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 91 (Number of characters: 94):
Listening is 
made up of three steps: receiving a message, processing it, and sending it back.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 92 (Number of characters: 158):
Providers 
should attempt to remain open to all messages from their patients (both verbal and 
nonverbal) and attempt to process as many messages as possible.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 93 (Number of characters: 136):
Clarification: Since we all speak from our own frame of reference, messages we send 
to others may not be received in the way we intend.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 94 (Number of characters: 228):
Clarification is a useful and 
necessary tool for all providers. Clarification can be used to help simplify a message 
that is being sent by patients or to help confirm the accuracy of what providers think 
they have understood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 95 (Number of characters: 154):
In-Session Example 3.1
Notice that the clarifying statement and question helped the provider and patient to 
more fully explore her feelings and thoughts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 96 (Number of characters: 161):
Given this new information, the provider is 
in a better position to explore the patient's concerns and to set up targeted efforts and 
strategies for treatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 97 (Number of characters: 214):
Paraphrasing and Reflection: These techniques involve restating the patient’s main 
thoughts in a different way or reflecting back the emotions the patient is currently 
experiencing to gain depth or clarification.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 98 (Number of characters: 51):
Patient 
 
I just do not feel like trying any more.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 99 (Number of characters: 45):
Provider:  
Tell me more about what you mean.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 100 (Number of characters: 221):
Patient: 
 
I just feel like giving up
Provider:  
Do you mean giving up on your goal to complete college; or are you  
 
 
 
referring to something different, like giving up on life and possibly  
 
 
 
harming yourself?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 101 (Number of characters: 111):
Patient: 
 
I am not referring to suicide, if that is what you mean; but I am feeling  
 
 
 
really depressed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 102 (Number of characters: 87):
Each day seems like such a struggle, and I often just  
 
 
 
feel like staying in bed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 103 (Number of characters: 442):
When I said “give up,” I guess I was referring to  
 
 
 
not wanting to face all the struggles I face in life … my school work,  
 
 
 
financial problems, relationship problems, etc. 

21
ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 3
In-Session Example 3.2
 
In this example of paraphrasing, the provider gives back to the patient what he or she 
heard, which allows the patient to hear her own words and react with a more detailed 
response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 104 (Number of characters: 162):
The use of paraphrasing in this example facilitated a deeper understanding of 
the issue but also conveyed to the patient a feeling of being heard and understood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 105 (Number of characters: 590):
Listening for Themes and Summary Statements: Often, patients express thoughts, 
feelings and behaviors that become thematic across situations. Although novice 
providers may initially have difficulties identifying this thematic content, repetition 
over time (e.g., across sessions) usually helps to create a clearer picture of the salient 
therapeutic issues that require attention or focus. With experience, providers become 
more effective and efficient at identifying thematic content. Once identified, thematic content can be a very powerful mechanism to influence 
treatment outcomes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 106 (Number of characters: 299):
Summarization is the technique that brings thematic content into 
the purview of the patient. Summarization is a condensed phrasing of the patient’s 
responses over a specific period of time (e.g., across the session, since the outset of 
treatment, since the onset of his/her current difficulties.)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 107 (Number of characters: 241):
You should rephrase the 
themes, and repeat them back to the patient for clarification. 
BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES TO BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP
Setting limits in an empathetic manner is an essential tool for new providers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 108 (Number of characters: 150):
Many new 
providers desire to “make it all better,” in that they may coddle and console the patient 
and are distracted from working on deeper issues.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 109 (Number of characters: 283):
A provider can create a holding 
environment through empathetic words and active listening. A holding environment is a 
setting in which the patient feels like he or she is being heard and that he or she is in a 
safe and secure place to voice thoughts and feelings without judgment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 110 (Number of characters: 97):
Moving from rapport and relationship building to assessment and goal setting can be 
challenging.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 111 (Number of characters: 215):
When provider and patient are “on the same page,” this transition appears 
Patient: 
 
Since my fiancé’s death, I feel like every day is a struggle; and I often  
 
 
 
question whether my life will ever get better.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 112 (Number of characters: 66):
I just miss him so much  
 
 
 
that I think about him constantly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 113 (Number of characters: 72):
I don’t know what to do, but the pain  
 
 
 
is getting to be too much.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 114 (Number of characters: 147):
Provider:  
You are really struggling to feel better, and much of your pain comes  
 
 
 
from the grief and loss you feel from losing your fiancé.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 115 (Number of characters: 117):
You may  
 
 
 
even be questioning whether or not this pain will subside because it  
 
 
 
is getting unmanageable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 116 (Number of characters: 8):
Patient:

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 117 (Number of characters: 21):
Yes, that is correct.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 118 (Number of characters: 82):
I do not want you to think that I think only about  
 
 
 
the pain of losing him.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 119 (Number of characters: 173):
The pain I feel comes from my intense feelings  
 
 
 
of loss, but this pain is also because I miss all the things he meant to  
 
 
 
me and the joy he brought to my life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 120 (Number of characters: 100):
I am really struggling because I  
 
 
 
do not want to let go of him, but holding on hurts so much.

seamless.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 122 (Number of characters: 75):
Often, however, patients and providers are not speaking the same 
language.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 123 (Number of characters: 153):
For example, a provider may feel most comfortable when tackling 
a certain issue first; whereas a patient may wish to focus on a different problem first.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 124 (Number of characters: 133):
When the provider and patient are not in congruence regarding goals, the move between 
rapport building and goal setting is strained.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 125 (Number of characters: 152):
To overcome this issue, providers are 
encouraged to use motivational interviewing strategies (see Rollnick, Butler, and Mason 
– Chapters 3, 4, and 5).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 126 (Number of characters: 160):
Primary techniques involve listening to the patient, following the 
patient's lead and/or motivation, and setting collaborative and mutually agreed-upon 
goals.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 127 (Number of characters: 199):
A vital aspect to transitioning from rapport to goal setting involves assessing the 
importance, confidence, and readiness of the patient about specific treatment goals (see 
Goal Setting, Module 8).

ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 4
Module 4: Case Conceptualization and Treatment Planning
OBJECTIVES 
• To better understand the role of case conceptualization in cognitive behavioral therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 138 (Number of characters: 110):
• To develop specific case conceptualization skills, including: 
a. Assessing patient concerns/difficulties
b.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 139 (Number of characters: 47):
Establishing a treatment plan (goal setting)
c.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 140 (Number of characters: 551):
Identifying treatment obstacles 
What Are Case Conceptualization and Treatment Planning, 
and Why Are They Important in Brief CBT?
Case conceptualization is a framework used to 1) understand patients and their current 
problems, 2) inform treatment and intervention techniques and 3) serve as a foundation to 
assess patient change/progress. Case conceptualization also aids in establishing rapport 
and a sense of hope for patients. Case conceptualization is vital to effective treatment and represents a defining 
characteristic of expert providers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 141 (Number of characters: 152):
Using these skills, providers are better able to define 
a treatment plan using intervention techniques that provide the best opportunities for 
change.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 142 (Number of characters: 192):
This focused and informed approach provides the roadmap for both patients 
and providers and should include a foundation for assessing change/progress using 
measurement-based care principles.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 143 (Number of characters: 238):
Case conceptualization (Figure 4.1) is particularly 
important for short-term therapy, as it serves to focus both the patient and clinician on the 
salient issues to avoid ancillary problems that often serve as distractions to core goals.

(Indications / Contraindications)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 146 (Number of characters: 107):
• To better should begin during the first session and become increasingly 
refined as treatment progresses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 147 (Number of characters: 114):
• An assessment of current difficulties and the creation of a problem list should occur 
during the first session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 148 (Number of characters: 1):
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 149 (Number of characters: 219):
A treatment plan (including treatment goals) should be addressed early in treatment 
(sessions 1, 2). Early conceptualization and treatment planning may require 
modification as additional information becomes available.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 150 (Number of characters: 148):
• Treatment plans and goals should be routinely revisited to ensure that the patient is 
improving and agrees with the flow of the therapeutic work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 153 (Number of characters: 176):
CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION STEP 1: Assessing Patient Concerns/Difficulties The patient’s presenting concerns and current functioning can be assessed in a number 
of different ways.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 154 (Number of characters: 91):
The following section outlines several possible avenues for identifying 
problems/concerns.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 155 (Number of characters: 2):
A)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 156 (Number of characters: 190):
Using established self-report symptom inventories. A common practice in CBT involves 
the use of self-report symptom measures to assess baseline functioning as well as 
therapeutic progress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 157 (Number of characters: 254):
Frequently used measures for depression and anxiety include the 
Beck Depression Inventory – Second Edition, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression), 
Geriatric Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
7-item scale.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 158 (Number of characters: 279):
Self-report measures are often completed by patients while in the waiting room and evaluated 
by the clinician during the session. Often self-report measures can serve as a routine 
agenda item during CBT sessions and highlight important improvements and/or continuing 
symptoms.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 159 (Number of characters: 255):
Information obtained from these self-report inventories can also provide insight 
into the way the patient thinks and behaves and factors that might be important areas of need 
and will inform treatment progress and treatment continuation/discontinuation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 160 (Number of characters: 17):
B) Problem lists.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 161 (Number of characters: 142):
These are a common and useful strategy for identifying the 
psychological, social, occupational, and financial difficulties faced by patients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 162 (Number of characters: 137):
Providers 
who use problem lists typically elicit a list of five to 10 difficulties from the patient during 
the first part of session 1.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 163 (Number of characters: 97):
Problems are best identified using open-ended questions (e.g., 
“What brings you to this clinic?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 164 (Number of characters: 65):
“What issues would you like to focus on in our work 
together?”).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 165 (Number of characters: 238):
Problems are best described in terms of symptom frequency (How often does 
the symptom occur?), intensity (How mild or severe is it?) and functional impact (What 
influence does the symptom have on daily functioning or general distress?).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 166 (Number of characters: 242):
ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 4

ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 4
Some patients may describe their difficulties or goals in vague or abstract 
ways, such as, “I want to improve my life,” or I want to be happy again.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 167 (Number of characters: 95):
Problems and subsequent goals are best described in specific terms to maintain 
clinical focus.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 168 (Number of characters: 65):
For example, specific problems are listed in the following table.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 169 (Number of characters: 55):
Table 4.1 Problem List Example
C) Assessing cognitions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 170 (Number of characters: 258):
Within the CBT model, it is often helpful to examine the patient’s 
thoughts, especially how the patient perceives them. A commonly used, structured way 
to examine these factors is to assess (ask questions related to) how the patients perceives 
themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 171 (Number of characters: 82):
For example, a patient might self-describe as incapable, not useful, or a 
burden.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 172 (Number of characters: 68):
They may generally perceive others to be critical or hard to please.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 173 (Number of characters: 194):
And their view 
of the future might be largely pessimistic and involve beliefs that the future will include 
only more losses and disappointments (see also Thought Records in Modules 11 and 12).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 174 (Number of characters: 2):
D)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 175 (Number of characters: 178):
Assessing behaviors and precipitating situations. Precipitating situations are events, 
behaviors, thoughts, or emotions that activate, trigger, or compound patient difficulties.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 176 (Number of characters: 298):
The Antecedents, Behavior, Consequences (ABC) Model is a model for examining 
behavior (symptoms) in a larger context. It postulates that behaviors are largely 
determined by antecedents (events that precede behavior/thoughts/mood) and 
consequences (events that follow the behavior/thoughts/mood).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 177 (Number of characters: 92):
The ABC model (see worksheet at the end of this module) is used in a functional 
assessment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 178 (Number of characters: 92):
It follows the premise that behavior (B) is shaped by antecedents (A) and 
consequences (C).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 179 (Number of characters: 213):
The antecedent occurs before a behavior and may be a trigger for a 
particular reaction in the patient. Behavior is any activity (even a thought or feeling) that 
the patient exhibits in response to an antecedent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 180 (Number of characters: 125):
Consequences are events that occur 
after the behavior and direct the patient to either continue or discontinue the behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 181 (Number of characters: 839):

26
ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 4
Two kinds of consequences are examined in a functional assessment:  
short-term and long-term consequences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 182 (Number of characters: 252):
A) Antecedents: Antecedents, or events that occur before a behavior, typically elicit 
emotional and physiological responses. Antecedents may be affective (an emotion), 
somatic (a physiological response), behavioral (an act), or cognitive (a thought).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 183 (Number of characters: 90):
They 
are also subject to contextual (situational) and relational (interpersonal) factors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 184 (Number of characters: 202):
For 
example, patients who report depressed mood (emotion) may feel bad when they are 
alone at home late at night (contextual antecedent) or better when they are around family 
(relational antecedent).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 185 (Number of characters: 101):
Alternatively, they may feel depressed by thinking, “I will always 
be alone” (cognitive antecedent).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 186 (Number of characters: 204):
It’s important to remember that antecedents can both 
increase and decrease a particular behavior. To help your patiens identify antecedents, teach them to pinpoint conditions that affect 
their behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 187 (Number of characters: 73):
In-Session Example 4.1
“What were you feeling right before you did that?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 188 (Number of characters: 64):
(Affective)
“What happens to you physically before this happens?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 189 (Number of characters: 18):
Do you feel sick?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 190 (Number of characters: 63):
(Somatic) 
“How do you normally act right before this happens?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 191 (Number of characters: 70):
(Behavioral)
“What thoughts go through your mind before this happens?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 192 (Number of characters: 54):
(Cognitive)
“Where and when does this usually happen?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 193 (Number of characters: 214):
(Contextual)
“Do you do this with everyone, or just when you are around certain people?” 
(Relational) 
B) Behaviors: A behavior is anything the patient does, feels, or thinks immediately 
following the antecedent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 194 (Number of characters: 302):
Each behavior that your patient displays could potentially 
include an affective component (feelings or moods), a somatic component (bodily 
sensations such as rapid heartbeat or stomachache), a behavioral component (what a 
patient does or doesn’t do), and a cognitive component (thoughts or beliefs).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 195 (Number of characters: 494):
C) Consequences: Consequences are categorized as being either positive or negative. Positive consequences increase the chances that a behavior will be repeated through the 
experience of something pleasant or the removal of something negative (e.g., do not have 
to do a chore). Negative consequences decrease the occurrence of a behavior, either by 
the presence of something noxious (e.g., being yelled at) or the absence of something 
desired (e.g., a child being grounded from watching TV).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 196 (Number of characters: 106):
Patients tend to repeat behaviors 
that result in something positive or the removal of something negative.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 197 (Number of characters: 25):
Identifying Consequences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 198 (Number of characters: 192):
Similarly to identifying antecedents, when you and a patient 
are attempting to identify the consequences of a certain behavior, it is important to 
explore all components of each consequence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 199 (Number of characters: 118):
27
ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 4
In-Session Example 4.2
“How do you feel immediately after this occurs?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 200 (Number of characters: 83):
(Affective)
“Do you have any bodily sensations after this happens, like trembling?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 201 (Number of characters: 183):
(Somatic) 
“How do you react after this behavior occurs? (Behavioral)
“What do you think about after this happens?” (Cognitive)
“Are you in a different place when this behavior ends?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 202 (Number of characters: 64):
(Contextual)
“Are there any people who make this behavior worse?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 203 (Number of characters: 16):
Make it better?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 204 (Number of characters: 12):
(Relational)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 205 (Number of characters: 413):
When completing a functional assessment, examine both short- and long-term 
consequences. Short-term consequences tend to be behavioral reinforcers, while long-
term consequences tend to be negative outcomes. In the case of addiction, the short-
term consequence of using a substance is intoxication, or escape from a negative 
mood; the long-term consequence may be legal trouble, family problems, or a hangover.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 206 (Number of characters: 133):
Understanding the positive and negative consequences of a behavior for a patient 
helps design the timing and nature of intervention.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 207 (Number of characters: 221):
For example, in the case above, an 
intervention would need to follow a noxious antecedent to offset the negative mood it 
causes. Treating the negative mood would then decrease the need for escape through 
substance use.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 208 (Number of characters: 149):
A variety of questions may be used to elucidate a short-term consequence: 
In-Session Example 4.3
“Does this behavior get you attention in some way?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 209 (Number of characters: 206):
“What good things happen as a result of this behavior?” 
“Does this help you in some way?”
“Do you feel a certain ‘rush’ from doing this?” “Does this behavior help you avoid something you don’t want to do?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 210 (Number of characters: 259):
2. CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION STEP 2: Clinical Hypotheses and Treatment Plan 
Establishing focused clinical hypotheses based upon the information obtained in Case 
Conceptualization Step #1 serves to direct intervention options and possible treatment 
techniques.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 211 (Number of characters: 195):
These hypotheses may require adaptation as new information becomes 
available during treatment. Clinical hypotheses can either be used exclusively by the 
provider or can be shared with patients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 212 (Number of characters: 99):
Generally, sharing this information improves trust 
and communication between patient and provider.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 213 (Number of characters: 206):
A focused clinical hypothesis for a person with depression might be as follows:
"Since your retirement, you have experienced many life transitions and numerous losses 
(e.g., financial, social, functional).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 214 (Number of characters: 142):
Your thoughts, which used to be largely positive and 
ambitious, are now negative and pessimistic; and you appear to be fearful of the future.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 215 (Number of characters: 195):
In 

28
ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 4
reaction to your mood and negative thoughts, you have reduced the number 
of your activities; and you have begun to withdraw from your family."

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 216 (Number of characters: 177):
The end result of case conceptualization is formation of a treatment plan, an agreed-upon 
strategy between patient and provider that gives direction to the therapeutic process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 217 (Number of characters: 196):
A 
treatment plan should include a presentation of the causes of the patient's current difficulties 
(e.g., cognitive and behavioral factors creating symptoms or difficulties) and a specific plan.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 218 (Number of characters: 91):
When presenting the plan, actively involve the patient and incorporate his or her feedback.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 219 (Number of characters: 208):
In-Session Example 4.4
Example: “In the brief amount of time we have spent together, it appears that we have 
identified some thoughts and behaviors that are likely contributing to your current 
difficulties.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 220 (Number of characters: 145):
In particular, your view of yourself and your future are quite negative; 
and you have stopped doing many things that used to bring you pleasure.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 221 (Number of characters: 135):
My 
recommendation would be to further explore your thoughts and see if we can find a 
more balanced view of your current difficulties.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 222 (Number of characters: 102):
I would also like to talk with you more 
about re-engaging in activities you used to find pleasurable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 223 (Number of characters: 52):
What do you think about 
these targets for therapy?"

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 224 (Number of characters: 74):
3. CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION STEP 3: Identifying Possible Treatment Obstacles

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 225 (Number of characters: 90):
It is not uncommon for patients to simply agree with recommendations from their 
provider.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 226 (Number of characters: 120):
However, it is important to identify potential obstacles to treatment early on to 
avoid setbacks or treatment failures.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 227 (Number of characters: 290):
Asking for frequent feedback from the patient helps 
to reduce over-compliance and serves to include the patient in a collaborative and active 
treatment approach. As part of this collaborative venture, it is important to ask patients 
whether they see any potential obstacles to treatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 228 (Number of characters: 441):
Barriers might include logistic 
difficulties (financial, travel), personal beliefs (concerns about stigma, effectiveness of 
treatment) or interpersonal issues (family not supportive of therapy).

goal-

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 230 (Number of characters: 18):
setting endeavors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 231 (Number of characters: 76):
Treatment goals should be reasonable, measurable 
and as simple as possible.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 232 (Number of characters: 123):
» Because of limited time, the focus of treatment in brief CBT also generally 
limits the depth of cognitive interventions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 233 (Number of characters: 344):
For example, it is quite frequent 
to address automatic thoughts and intermediate beliefs as foci of treatment, 
while addressing core beliefs is often difficult. If core beliefs are addressed, 
this usually occurs indirectly through more surface-level intervention 
techniques or at a time when the patient is particularly ready for such work.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 234 (Number of characters: 126):

OBJECTIVES

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 245 (Number of characters: 171):
• To understand the importance of patients’ cultural backgrounds and experiences  
in brief CBT
• To learn how to assess and integrate patients’ culture into psychotherapy

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 246 (Number of characters: 54):
What Is Culture, and Why Is It Important in Brief CBT?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 247 (Number of characters: 137):
Culture defines individuals’ specific “ways of being” that are shaped by the intersection 
of their identity and their lived experiences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 248 (Number of characters: 156):
Culture influences our behaviors and 
impacts our lifestyle choices, which is why it is an important factor in psychotherapy and 
therapeutic relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 249 (Number of characters: 175):
Not only should providers become aware of patients’ unique 
cultures, but they should also consider their own culture to form genuine and effective 
therapeutic relationships.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 250 (Number of characters: 143):
Cultural recognition and appreciation begin with an understanding of an individual’s race, 
age, and gender; however, culture goes much deeper.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 251 (Number of characters: 145):
Although two individuals may have 
similar physical identifiers of culture, past experiences and unseen forms of culture can 
create differences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 252 (Number of characters: 91):
For example, two Mexican American men may look the same and even 
be in the same age group.

chunk 258 (Number of characters: 151):
These models explain 
how individuals interpret their identity through interactions with others, and their basis 
is often minority or majority status.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 259 (Number of characters: 232):
For example, an integrated model of cultural/racial 
development from Hoffman and Hoffman (2006) is included, which depicts various stages 
of development and how these stages interact with others’ development (found in Table 
5.2).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 260 (Number of characters: 256):
You and your patient may be at different stages of the model, which may impact 
the conceptualization of your respective cultures, how culture influences the therapeutic 
interaction, and how culture influences the interpretation of stressors and symptoms.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 261 (Number of characters: 127):
The 
Hoffman and Hoffman model emphasizes the importance of recognizing minority and 
majority status when considering culture.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 262 (Number of characters: 149):
Use this model to guide conceptualization of 
culture and, more importantly, to consider cultural stages as part of the overall therapeutic 
process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 263 (Number of characters: 628):
The Hoffman and Hoffman model provides one example, but you may wish to use 
other cultural models in your practice, such as:
• Black American Racial Identity by William Cross (1991)
• White Racial Identity Model by Janet Helms (1990)
• Stages of Acculturation by John W. Berry (2005)
• Filipino American Racial Identity Model by Kevin Nadal (2011)

Stage III.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 269 (Number of characters: 293):
Immersion
Due to the effects of racism and sexism, 
members of minority groups begin to

Stage IV.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 271 (Number of characters: 303):
Emersion
Anger towards the majority group causes 
minorities to associate only with the 
group they belong to, avoiding contact 
with the majority. Retreat

is for minorities.

--------------------------------------------------

It may also feel frustration 
towards other members of its own group 
who do not agree.

CULTURE AND PSYCHOTHERAPY The goal of culturally competent psychotherapy is to ensure that patients’ 
experiences and culture are considered when providing care.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 279 (Number of characters: 96):
Optimal care is achieved 
when both the provider and patient are collaborative in the treatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 280 (Number of characters: 177):
Appropriate 
consideration of patients’ backgrounds and experiences results in patients’ feeling heard 
and understood, creating a safe space for patients to express themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 281 (Number of characters: 227):
Acknowledging 
your patient’s culture provides an opportunity to fully understand the patient and conveys 
a level of openness that encourages discussion and exploration of other factors important 
in the psychotherapy process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 282 (Number of characters: 151):
Traditional CBT and Western models of psychotherapy typically have not considered 
or accounted for ethnic and cultural values and beliefs of patients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 283 (Number of characters: 280):
Historically, minority 
patients have high dropout rates, due to various challenges to care, such as:
1. Psychotherapy can feel “foreign” to non-Western or underrepresented groups because 
emotional expression and discussing personal experiences may conflict with certain 
values.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 284 (Number of characters: 70):
For example, some groups view expressing emotions as weak or unstable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 285 (Number of characters: 76):
Also, 
some may view discussing themselves as rude or insensitive to others.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 286 (Number of characters: 2):
2.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 287 (Number of characters: 179):

limiting the possibility for patients to feel like a collaborative partner in their care.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 288 (Number of characters: 112):
Manualized treatments are developed to be efficacious and are typically not created to 
be culturally sensitive.

When?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 292 (Number of characters: 31):
(Indications/Contraindications)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 293 (Number of characters: 69):
You should be aware of your patients’ and your own cultural identity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 294 (Number of characters: 292):
Given the importance 
of the therapeutic relationship in psychotherapy, it is critical to not only communicate 
and model nonspecific factors (e.g., warmth, genuineness) but also consider culture and 
factors of diversity as a process that occurs initially and throughout the therapy process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 295 (Number of characters: 137):
IMPACT OF CULTURE ON MENTAL HEALTH
Look to minimize any negative outcomes associated with the intersection of culture and 
mental health.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 296 (Number of characters: 240):
The Transactional Model of Stress and Coping (Figure 5.1.) describes how 
patients react or appraise stressful situations or triggering events and, subsequently, how 
they seek to cope with those stressors, based on their initial appraisal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 297 (Number of characters: 154):
Patients appraise 
situations through their own cultural lens, based on their own past experiences of coping 
and the experiences of others close to them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 298 (Number of characters: 72):
In addition, stressors and triggering events 
can be cultural in nature.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 299 (Number of characters: 349):
For example, experiencing discrimination at work or receiving a 
life-altering medical diagnosis or physical/mental disability impacts both our culture and 
our mental health. If you are aware and accepting of cultural differences when assessing 
and treating mental health issues, you will be better informed and in tune with your 
patients’ needs.

EVALUATION OF PATIENTS’ CULTURE

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 301 (Number of characters: 253):
Although providers are experts in mental health and mental health treatment, patients are 
experts of their own identity and life experiences. To provide treatment, providers should 
understand and be willing to explore each patient’s lived experiences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 302 (Number of characters: 81):
Do not assume that 
culture will always play a role in patients’ psychopathology.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 303 (Number of characters: 104):
Provide your patients with 
the opportunity to hypothesize how aspects of their culture may play a role.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 304 (Number of characters: 65):
Examples of 
how to begin these conversations are provided below.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 305 (Number of characters: 134):
Important to note: the patients may 
be clear as to how culture influences their symptoms, ongoing stressors, or presenting 
concerns.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 306 (Number of characters: 102):
Therefore, understanding patients’ experiences may be more helpful for the 
provider than the patient.

chunk 307 (Number of characters: 32):
EVALUATION OF PROVIDER’S CULTURE

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 308 (Number of characters: 94):
In addition to cultural considerations of the patient, consider your own cultural experiences.

All individuals have unique experiences and backgrounds that may differ from another’s.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 310 (Number of characters: 143):

PATIENT AND PROVIDER INTERACTION

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 313 (Number of characters: 296):
The interaction of two cultures often leads to cultural differences. Under ideal 
circumstances, cultural differences create opportunities for individuals to learn about 
others’ cultures, highlight commonalities among shared cultural experiences, and develop 
awareness of differing experiences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 314 (Number of characters: 134):
However, cultural differences can also lead to negative 
experiences and outcomes, such as discrimination, stereotypes, and injustice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 315 (Number of characters: 168):
Providers 
and patients bring their own lived experiences to the therapeutic relationship, but it is 
imperative to model behaviors that attend to cultural differences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 316 (Number of characters: 338):
This may be the first 
time your patient is introduced to the concept of cultural difference and, thus, negative 
outcomes can be directed towards you. Just as patients can be negatively impacted by 
not acknowledging culture, you as a provider can be discriminated or stereotyped. Both you and your patient may experience discrimination.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 317 (Number of characters: 236):
Discrimination is the 
mistreatment of individuals based on societal or personal views of an aspect of their 
culture being inferior. Discrimination can be direct, such as overt racism and sexism, or 
indirect, such as microaggressions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 318 (Number of characters: 522):
Microaggressions are intentional or unintentional 
slights or behaviors directed towards others that indicate social inferiority, hostility, or 
derogation. For example, a teacher telling parents of an African American student that 
she is so articulate and well mannered may be an unintentional microaggression. Even 
though the teacher is trying to compliment the student, the teacher may be making a 
microaggression because of the underlying societal stereotype that African American 
students would present otherwise.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 319 (Number of characters: 145):
Both providers and patients should attend to the 
possibility of microaggressions and discuss any occurrences as much as possible in the 
moment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 320 (Number of characters: 253):
Awareness of explicit and implicit biases presented in Table 5.3 can help prevent 
microaggressions and discrimination from occurring. Table 5.3 Example of Explicit and Implicit Bias

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 354 (Number of characters: 192):
It is 
common for a brief CBT provider to feel tension between sticking to the brief CBT 
therapy protocol and providing patients with enough time to expand on their experiences 
and concerns.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 355 (Number of characters: 139):
However, most protocols emphasize the importance of building rapport; 
and addressing culture can help you build this therapeutic alliance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 356 (Number of characters: 416):
The exact “balance” 
between listening/assessing and forming a strong therapeutic relationship with the 
time necessary to deliver technical/skill-focused interventions will depend on many 
factors, including the needs of the patient, the duration of treatment, and the provider’s 
skillfulness in rapidly and effectively forming a strong relationship while maintaining a 
focus on active, skill-oriented techniques.

YOUR APPROACH DURING TREATMENT SHOULD SHIFT, 
BASED ON YOUR PATIENT’S PRESENTATION.

chunk 400 (Number of characters: 281):
Conducting therapy with technology-based modalities has rapidly increased for mental 
health care. Specifically, using technology-based approaches as a means for providing 
psychological services has served to reduce mental health disparities and overcome 
distance-based barriers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 401 (Number of characters: 1293):
Telemental health is the practice of using technology to provide 
mental health services and may include telephone, two-way video conferencing, mobile 
phone applications, web-based text messaging, email-based interventions, web-based 
chat messaging, or asynchronous telepsychiatry (formerly store-and-forward services). These remote telecommunication modalities present opportunities to enhance mental 
health care through services offered clinic to clinic (e.g., provider located in one clinic 
while the patient is physically present at a different clinic location) as well as from a 
provider directly into patients’ homes or other secure locations. Telemental health services may be used effectively across an array of settings including, 
but not limited to, hospitals, short- and long-term care facilities, school systems, 
institutional correctional facilities, rural health centers, and community mental health 
clinics. Telemental health modalities are associated with clinical effectiveness, treatment 
adherence, patient and provider satisfaction, psychotherapeutic alliance outcomes, and 
cost effectiveness commensurate with services provided face-to-face. Telemental health 
services are useful in providing evidence-based psychotherapies to individuals, groups, 
and families.

chunk 403 (Number of characters: 31):
(Indications/Contraindications)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 404 (Number of characters: 185):
Technological advances and the subsequent integration into healthcare services have 
made remote delivery of mental health care accessible to underserved and disadvantaged 
populations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 405 (Number of characters: 124):
Telemental health services help minimize barriers that prevent patients’ 
access to care when they need it (see Figure 6.1).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 406 (Number of characters: 262):
When traditional face-to-face therapies 
are unavailable or inaccessible, alternative treatment modalities may be appropriate for 
individuals that frequently travel for work, those who serve during military deployments, 
and people who work irregular schedules.

--------------------------------------------------

Figure 6.1 Barriers to Mental Care Access
CONSIDERATIONS
Potential risks of using technological modalities when providing remote mental health 
treatment must be considered.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 408 (Number of characters: 152):
Risks involve the need for crises management procedures 
as well as clinical issues, including the potential for negative impact on patient functioning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 409 (Number of characters: 218):
For example, patients with anxiety may have fears associated with avoidance that are 
potentially maintained by using telehealth services and thereby reducing exposure to 
feared stimuli (e.g., going out of the house).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 410 (Number of characters: 247):
Additional precautions may be warranted to 
effectively observe and assess mobility (e.g., ask the patient to walk across the room in 
front of the camera) and hygiene (e.g., inquire about the last time a patient showered or 
brushed their teeth).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 411 (Number of characters: 268):
Patients may be offered various telemental health modalities, but it is the provider’s 
responsibility to ensure alignment with the patient’s presenting concerns as well as to be 
knowledgeable about data to support the intervention using the selected delivery method.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 412 (Number of characters: 106):
Some smartphone applications, for example, provide treatment programs that are not 
empirically supported.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 413 (Number of characters: 163):
Despite concerns about the appropriateness of technology-
based modalities, telemental health services have been used successfully across an 
array of populations.

• Age Group: Research has been conducted on telemental health with 
all age groups.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 415 (Number of characters: 182):
Providers should determine whether patients can effectively use a 
desired telemental health modality through direct conversations with patients about 
acceptability and feasibility.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 416 (Number of characters: 131):
Occasionally, patients from various age groups (e.g., older 
adults) may require some education on how to use different modalities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 417 (Number of characters: 177):
Typically, 
younger patients are more likely to desire technology-based treatment. However, 
patients of all age groups can be instructed on how to use technology for treatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 418 (Number of characters: 392):
• High Risk Populations: Clinical concerns arise when providing telemental health to 
patients who endorse current suicidal ideation or substance use. For patients with 
past suicidal ideation, consider the level of suicide risk, the length of time since the 
last reported episode of suicidal ideation, and the number of past episodes when 
deciding the appropriateness of telemental health.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 419 (Number of characters: 138):
High risk patients in crisis often 
require focused and highly intensive treatment approaches that may make weekly 
therapy inappropriate.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 420 (Number of characters: 689):
However, telehealth modalities may be an important element 
of a broader treatment approach that includes a mixture of face-to-face and virtual 
appointments. Ultimately, the decision to use telemental health with high-risk patients 
should be based upon clinical expertise; and a clear emergency plan should always be 
identified (i.e., emergency contact, involving family and friends). • Patients with Severe Mental Illness: Telemental health can be conducted with patients 
who have been diagnosed with severe mental illnesses. However, patients who are 
not adherent to psychotropic medication or other treatment recommendations may 
not be appropriate for telemental health treatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 421 (Number of characters: 74):
Distance may pose an ethical 
risk in ensuring the safety of your patient.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 422 (Number of characters: 184):
As with high-risk suicide patients, the use 
of telemental health procedures for those with serious mental illness may be most 
effective as part of a interdisciplinary treatment plan.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 423 (Number of characters: 35):
• Rural or Out-of-State Population:

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 424 (Number of characters: 99):
Telemental health is an optimal option for rural 
populations that do not have access to treatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 425 (Number of characters: 114):
However, different states have 
regulations on providing treatment across state lines, which should be considered.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 426 (Number of characters: 137):
• Exposure-Based Treatment: Telemental health services can increase effectiveness of 
treatment of anxiety- and trauma-related disorders.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 427 (Number of characters: 114):
Patients can use technology in 
their environment, allowing you to guide them through relevant exposure exercises.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 428 (Number of characters: 112):
• Treatment-Avoidant Populations: Telemental health options engage patients that may 
not otherwise use therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 429 (Number of characters: 93):
However, these care options can reinforce avoidance and 
limit patient progress in treatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 430 (Number of characters: 166):
Use your clinical judgment to determine if a patient 
high in avoidance or low in motivation is appropriate for telemental health throughout 
the course of treatment.

and you should consider it on a case-by-case basis.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 439 (Number of characters: 110):
As with any new procedure, you are 
encouraged to explore and be knowledgeable in the modalities and delivery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 440 (Number of characters: 406):
You must be 
vigilant and prepared (proactive) when using telehealth procedures. Various factors can 
be considered when using telemental health:
ASSESSING PATIENT SAFETY Although no condition-specific populations are currently considered inappropriate for 
telemental health services, individual patient safety should always be considered before 
providing services through any telemental health modality.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 441 (Number of characters: 34):
Current best practices include:
1.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 442 (Number of characters: 58):

locations to the home of a relative, friend, or other setting)
DETERMINING APPROPRIATENESS OF THE PATIENT’S CASE
Prospective telehealth providers are strongly encouraged to engage in self-assessment 
related to the provision of psychotherapeutic services across an array of telehealth 
modalities.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 447 (Number of characters: 220):
It is important to review issues spanning state and regulatory licensure, 
technology, ethics, professional relationships, and specific training requirements (STEPS) 
before providing telehealth services (See Table 6.1).

DETERMINING PATIENT COMFORT The decision to integrate innovative telehealth modalities into your practice 
must be carefully considered and discussed with patients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 450 (Number of characters: 104):
You must consider patient 
comfort and familiarity with technology as a patient’s willingness to engage.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 451 (Number of characters: 118):
Your 
patient’s opinion of telehealth modalities impacts outcomes of implementation and 
efficacy of service delivery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 452 (Number of characters: 309):
Additionally, it is important to consider only technologies 
that are accessible, practical, and feasible for the patient because a patient’s familiarity 
with technology may impact their view of a clinical professional (e.g., some patients may 
prefer in-person or technology-assisted clinical interactions).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 453 (Number of characters: 163):
The primary and secondary 
language of the provider and patient may impact service delivery such that a telephone-
based or in-person interpreter may be necessary.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 454 (Number of characters: 197):
Finally, providing care through any 
technology-based delivery system will not be effective if you do not ensure availability of 
time and resources before offering contact, communication and care.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 455 (Number of characters: 96):
You must be able to 
provide and maintain quality, consistent care for services to be effective.

TIPS FOR CONDUCTING A TELEMENTAL HEALTH SESSION
• Conduct a practice telesession before your first session with the patient.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 457 (Number of characters: 156):
This will 
decrease the likelihood of equipment failure and allow you and the patient to become 
comfortable with the modality before the treatment session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 458 (Number of characters: 110):
Some facilities offer services 
that will conduct practice calls with patients before sessions with providers.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 459 (Number of characters: 143):
• Look directly into the camera if you are conducting a video session, instead of at the 
patient’s image onscreen, to ensure good eye contact.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 460 (Number of characters: 108):
• Pay attention to your surrounding background area, and remove anything that may be 
distracting on camera.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 461 (Number of characters: 93):
• Wear plain clothing without busy patterns (e.g., plaid, geometric shapes) or bright colors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 462 (Number of characters: 408):
• Obtain patient’s emergency contact information at the beginning of every telemental 
health session and keep this information readily available through the session duration. • Verify patient’s physical address/location at the beginning of each appointment and 
note any changes that occur during the session. You should also take note of local 
emergency service information in the locality of the patient.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 463 (Number of characters: 12):
PLEASE NOTE:

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 464 (Number of characters: 84):
If you call

chunk 466 (Number of characters: 289):
OVERCOMING BARRIERS 
Providers who are unfamiliar with technology are often reluctant to provide 
psychotherapeutic interventions through technology-based modalities, due to fear 
of hampering the therapeutic alliance (e.g., communicating warmth, understanding, 
sensitivity, and empathy).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 467 (Number of characters: 501):
Although specific challenges to providing telemental health 
services do exist (see Table 6.2), both providers and mental health patients have observed 
the therapeutic alliance over distance-based technologies to be comparable with that of 
face-to-face clinical interactions. ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 6

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 7
Module 7: Orienting the Patient to Brief CBT
OBJECTIVES
• To learn how to convey information about the structure and content of CBT 
 » To introduce the cognitive behavioral model
 » To introduce the collaborative nature of the therapeutic relationship 
What is Orienting a Patient to Therapy, and Why Is This Process Important? Orienting the patient to therapy involves: 
• A discussion of the theory underlying brief CBT
• A description of how the presenting problems can be conceptualized and treated with 
this approach
• Education about the structure, format, and expectations of therapy 
Orientation for brief CBT involves a discussion of the focused and time-limited nature 
of the therapy, plus the provider’s rationale for selecting brief CBT to treat a particular 
problem.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 487 (Number of characters: 145):
As noted in Module 1, this rationale includes the strong research basis of brief 
CBT and the fact that it is an empirically supported treatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 488 (Number of characters: 103):
Many patients have little, if any, exposure to psychotherapy other than examples in the 
popular media.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 489 (Number of characters: 175):
Although media may be a good avenue for disseminating innovative 
treatment strategies and therapies, there is an abundance of misinformation that patients 
may be exposed to.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 490 (Number of characters: 361):
Conveying the legitimate science of CBT in ways that your patients 
can understand may help build motivation for change during the therapeutic process 
as well as debunk previously misinformed perspectives. Providing patients with an 
understanding of the therapeutic process allows them to be more active and aware of 
their role in the progression of therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 491 (Number of characters: 84):
Knowledge of the process of brief CBT enhances 
the collaborative nature of therapy.

When?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 493 (Number of characters: 31):
(Indications/Contraindications)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 494 (Number of characters: 216):
Discussing the rationale for CBT and describing the process of therapy should occur in the 
first session. However, it is useful to revisit the model throughout treatment to expand upon 
the rationale for CBT skills.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 495 (Number of characters: 275):
The explanation of the model can be tailored to the patient's 
presenting problem, and examples to explain each component can be drawn from those 
generated in discussing problems specific to your patients (e.g., "I can't seem to get out 
of bed, and then I feel worthless").

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 496 (Number of characters: 146):
For patients who think in concrete terms, it might be 
necessary to provide many examples and initially focus on behaviors rather than cognitions.

chunk 498 (Number of characters: 194):
(Instructions/Handouts) 
INTRODUCING THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL MODEL The cognitive behavioral model is a theoretical paradigm for explaining associations among 
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 499 (Number of characters: 169):
Most individuals believe that situations give rise to their 
emotions, as it may be easier to understand how intense emotional experiences occur in 
specific situations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 500 (Number of characters: 150):
However, the cognitive behavioral model suggests that thoughts we 
have about situations influence our behaviors and impact our emotions (Figure 7.1).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 501 (Number of characters: 190):
This 
perspective does not negate the impact of external/internal stimuli (i.e., situations) on 
emotions, rather it facilitates a shift in perspective to facilitate the therapeutic process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 502 (Number of characters: 120):
For 
instance, individuals who are depressed or anxious tend to display patterns of unhelpful 
or “inaccurate” thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 503 (Number of characters: 433):
In the cognitive elements of CBT, the provider trains patients in 
specific skills that help them learn to improve their mood and change behavior by modifying 
the way they think about situations. Figure 7.1 Cognitive Behavioral Model

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 7
INITIAL SESSION 
To prepare for the initial session, thoroughly review all intake information and 
use modules in this manual.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 504 (Number of characters: 94):
You need the intake information to  initially conceptualize 
and formulate a therapeutic plan.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 505 (Number of characters: 144):
Using the patient’s presenting problems, symptoms, 
current level of functioning, culture, and history helps in developing the therapeutic plan.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 506 (Number of characters: 262):
From the intake information, it is imperative that you assess the patient’s suicidality. This can be done by asking about the patient’s suicidal ideation, intent, or plan and 
determining his or her level of hopelessness, as well as the reasons for hopelessness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 507 (Number of characters: 113):
If the patient’s suicidality seems high, then crisis intervention is above all other 
therapeutic considerations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 508 (Number of characters: 201):
In the case of an acutely suicidal patient, seek supervision or 
consultation and follow approved clinic procedures for managing a suicidal patient (e.g., 
contact on-call psychiatrist for evaluation).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 509 (Number of characters: 487):
Patient Expectations for Treatment
You should inquire about what the patient knows about how therapy is conducted. Orienting 
your patient to therapy includes describing the cognitive-behavioral model and answering 
any questions he/she might have about the progression of therapy. Using the patient’s 
examples to help explain the cognitive-behavioral model will assist him/her in being able to 
see how the model can work and how it has worked for other patients with similar problems.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 510 (Number of characters: 535):
Patients may confuse psychotherapy (i.e., typically uses Socratic dialogue, motivational 
enhancement strategies, and collaborative planning to foster patients’ motivation for change 
to positively impact psychopathology) with counseling (i.e., advice is given and the focus 
may not be reducing the contribution of cognitive-behavioral components on patients’ 
problems). Further, patients often think therapy is a place where they will come and be 
lectured and told what to do, or a place to vent without a focus on behavior change.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 511 (Number of characters: 227):
It is 
essential in brief CBT that the patient understands that therapy is a partnership between 
the provider and the patient, in which they work together so that the patient can better 
understand feelings and solve problems.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 512 (Number of characters: 88):
Negotiating the amount of time the patient will need to be in therapy is also important.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 513 (Number of characters: 92):
For brief CBT, patients typically attend weekly individual sessions for four to eight weeks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 514 (Number of characters: 177):
However, the amount of time in therapy and the number of days a week can be reassessed 
periodically and adjusted to meet the needs of the patient (see Module 8 – Goal Setting).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 515 (Number of characters: 115):
Discussing Symptoms and Diagnostic Issues with the Patient
Most patients want to know how they have been diagnosed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 516 (Number of characters: 124):
Explain the disorder in terms of

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 7
Feedback
The collaborative piece of CBT involves asking a patient for feedback on the 
session (e.g., “What did you think about our session today?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 521 (Number of characters: 318):
Did we leave out anything 
you think is important to discuss?”) and on how the patient feels about the cognitive-
behavioral model (e.g., “Do you feel you have at least a basic understanding of the 
model, or should we be sure to review it in detail again next week?”) at the end of the 
first and subsequent sessions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 522 (Number of characters: 193):
Encouraging patients to offer feedback strengthens the rapport and trust within the 
therapeutic relationship and indicates to patients that they are active members of the 
therapeutic process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 523 (Number of characters: 92):
It shows that the provider cares about what patients think and feel 
and values their input.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 524 (Number of characters: 221):
This is also a time to resolve misunderstandings about the cognitive 
model or things that occurred in the session (e.g., “Was there anything that bothered you 
about the session, or anything that you’d like to change?”).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 525 (Number of characters: 139):
Getting feedback from the 
patient shows how important it is to work as a team and helps you work on sharpening 
your abilities in therapy.

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 8
Module 8: Goal Setting
OBJECTIVES
• To understand the concept of goal setting in brief CBT
• To acquire skills to set feasible and appropriate goals in brief CBT
What is Goal Setting, and Why Is It Important To Set Goals in Therapy? Goal setting is the process of collaboratively identifying specific therapeutic outcomes for 
treatment. Goals must be observable, measurable and achievable and relate to cognitive 
or behavioral changes relevant to the patient’s presenting problem. Goals are tied to 
specific skills to be addressed in treatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 540 (Number of characters: 193):
Goals increase the continuity of sessions; allow 
directed, focused treatment; and enable the patient and provider to assess the progress of 
therapy and identify change in an objective manner.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 541 (Number of characters: 5):
When?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 542 (Number of characters: 31):
(Indications/Contraindications)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 543 (Number of characters: 380):
In addition to identifying the problem and building rapport, goal setting is one of the 
first therapeutic activities to be completed in brief CBT. Although goals can be changed/
modified at any point during therapy, to maximize applicability and benefit to the patient, 
a preliminary set of goals should be established and agreed upon by the end of the first or 
second session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 544 (Number of characters: 4):
How?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 545 (Number of characters: 23):
(Instructions/Handouts)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 546 (Number of characters: 59):
Goal setting begins with the identification of broad goals.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 547 (Number of characters: 124):
These are global and refer 
to areas of functioning (e.g., family, work, social relationships, financial concerns, 
health).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 548 (Number of characters: 193):
Broad goals are closely tied to your case conceptualization and the patient’s 
presenting problem. Once broad goals are identified collaboratively, you and the patient should prioritize 
goals.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 549 (Number of characters: 136):
This process involves determining the most central issues that cause concern and 
arranging them from most important to least important.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 550 (Number of characters: 175):
Starting with the problem that 
has the best chance of being solved and is central to the patient’s presenting concerns 
can help increase the patient’s commitment to therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 551 (Number of characters: 180):
If one skill is prerequisite to a 
subsequent goal, you can prioritize that goal in treatment (e.g., relaxation before exposure, 
awareness of thoughts before thought challenging).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 552 (Number of characters: 151):
Use a graded approach to goals, in which you take small steps in service of the larger goal 
each week through session content or homework assignments.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 553 (Number of characters: 209):
Identifying and sequencing 
action steps involve breaking each goal into smaller steps to help the patient know what 
to do at every stage of accomplishing the goal without feeling overwhelmed by a huge 
task.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 554 (Number of characters: 102):
It is important to note that all patient concerns may not be attended to in a brief 
treatment format.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 555 (Number of characters: 268):
58
ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 8
Once goals have been identified and prioritized, they are operationalized, 
which involves defining the goal and all the steps that it will take to achieve it 
in concrete, observable/measurable cognitive or behavioral terms.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 556 (Number of characters: 156):
Another important process of brief CBT is ongoing measurement-based care (MBC) used 
to assess the progression of the patient’s symptoms throughout therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 557 (Number of characters: 141):
Use disorder-
specific, validated self-report tools allowing patients to identify the degree specific 
symptoms contribute to their distress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 558 (Number of characters: 132):
This process informs baseline distress and end-of-
treatment progress and identifies areas still requiring attention during therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 559 (Number of characters: 128):
You can 
administer self-report tools to patients during the first and last sessions and as frequently 
as each therapy session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 567 (Number of characters: 301):
ASSESSING FACILITATORS, BARRIERS, IMPORTANCE, AND CONFIDENCE
Once a goal or multiple goals have been established, it is critical to assess the patient’s 
situation and attitudes about the goals. For example, ask whether there are aspects of 
the patient’s life that may facilitate or inhibit the goal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 568 (Number of characters: 131):
A strong family and social-support 
system may help a patient to reach a goal, but a functional limitation may create an 
obstacle.

goal attainment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 570 (Number of characters: 103):

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 8
Assessments of importance and confidence are also important.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 571 (Number of characters: 130):
Ask the 
patients to rate the importance of the goal on a scale of 0 to 100 (where 0 is 
not important and 100 is very important).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 572 (Number of characters: 75):
Discuss ratings lower than 60 or so, and refine 
goals to increase meaning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 573 (Number of characters: 72):
Similarly, ask patients to rate their confidence in obtaining 
the goal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 574 (Number of characters: 105):
Here, confidence ratings could be a little lower but would, hopefully, increase as 
treatment progresses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 575 (Number of characters: 268):
TROUBLESHOOTING GOAL SETTING 
Some clues that goals may need modification are worsening symptoms, no change 
in symptoms, patient failure to complete homework (see Module 10: Homework), and 
patient/collateral report that the patient is not benefitting from treatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 576 (Number of characters: 162):
In these 
cases, it is important to revisit initial goals with the patient and elicit feedback about the 
progress of therapy (e.g., “What do you find helpful?”).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 577 (Number of characters: 48):
Often, too-ambitious goals need 
to be modified.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 578 (Number of characters: 437):
In these cases, it is important to frame the revision in terms of taking small 
steps towards lasting change, normalize the difficulty of making changes when depressed 
or anxious, and join the patient (e.g., “I think I may have gotten a little ahead of myself; 
let’s modify these a little, so that they can be the most help for you”; “I may have missed 
the mark on this one; what do you think about adding/changing/removing a goal?”).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 579 (Number of characters: 77):
Goal 
revision should not imply to patients that they have failed in therapy.

the patient is experiencing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 583 (Number of characters: 91):
Create a new goal 
pertinent to what the patient believes is worsening and what might help.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 584 (Number of characters: 123):
At this point, 
you should also consult a supervisor/colleague or other professional (e.g., patient’s 
treating physician).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 585 (Number of characters: 150):
If patients are not improving, elicit their feedback about changes they are experiencing 
and their perceptions about why these changes have occurred.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 586 (Number of characters: 112):
If a patient seems to have 
trouble understanding the assignments, focus on more concrete and behavioral skills.

What Is Agenda Setting, and Why Is It Important? Agenda setting is a collaborative process through which you and the patient decide how 
session time will be spent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 637 (Number of characters: 140):
You and the patient offer items you would like to discuss and then 
decide the order of items and the amount of time you will spend on each.

--------------------------------------------------

(Instructions/Handouts)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 652 (Number of characters: 371):
It is your responsibility to model how to set agendas for the patient. In the first few 
sessions, you will be setting the agenda because often the patient is unsure of what 
is being asked or what to discuss in therapy. You can help patients become more 
comfortable with setting their own agenda by asking questions like, “What is the main 
reason you came to therapy?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 653 (Number of characters: 165):
or “What is causing you the most trouble right now?” or 
“What are your most pressing issues today?” or “What are your thoughts about the focus 
of today’s session?”

identify positive and negative change.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 666 (Number of characters: 220):
If medication management or physician 
collaboration is part of the patient’s treatment, this is also a good time to check 
on any side-effects the patient might be having from medication and make 
adjustments as needed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 667 (Number of characters: 83):
2. Bridge discussion from previous session with the current session (Five minutes).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 668 (Number of characters: 114):
In bridging sessions, you are checking the patient’s understanding of what was 
discussed in the previous session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 669 (Number of characters: 148):
Reinforcing what the patient learned in past 
sessions is essential to the improvement that the patient makes outside the 
therapeutic relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 670 (Number of characters: 89):
Having the patient complete a Bridging Worksheet can 
assist in this stage of the agenda.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 671 (Number of characters: 98):
Some issues discussed during this phase could 
become items on the agenda for the current session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 672 (Number of characters: 82):
3. Set the agenda for the current session and prioritize the items (Five minutes).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 673 (Number of characters: 389):
First ask patients what they would like to discuss, and then offer an item. If 
patients bring several agenda items, they might need to indicate which is the most 
important to discuss first. When patients offer a situation as an item (e.g., fight with 
boyfriend followed by food binge), you can use the situation as part of their agenda 
item, that is, as part of the skill being taught.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 674 (Number of characters: 78):
For example, you can use the above 
scenario to teach/review a thought record.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 675 (Number of characters: 75):
4. Review any homework given in the previous session (Five to ten minutes).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 676 (Number of characters: 388):
Patients who do between-session homework improve more than those who do not. To reinforce and troubleshoot between-session learning, it is important to review 
homework. In-session review serves two purposes: it reinforces the importance 
of homework and allows you to assess skill acquisition. If you identify errors in 
homework, you can use additional session time to review the skill.

--------------------------------------------------

homework can take a small amount of time; or it can take the entire session, 
depending on what patients have learned from doing it and what difficulties they 
have encountered in completing it.

If you are running 
short on time, inform the patient that you will discuss the other items at your 
next appointment.

--------------------------------------------------

Set up homework that is directly connected to what has been 
discussed in the session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 682 (Number of characters: 70):
6. Summarize the current session and exchange feedback (Five minutes).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 683 (Number of characters: 41):
Two types of summarizing are recommended.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 684 (Number of characters: 139):
The first is a brief summary that 
should be done after the conclusion of each section of the agenda to reinforce 
what has been discussed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 685 (Number of characters: 232):
The second type is used to clarify and remind patients 
of the thoughts they have presented and how those thoughts changed as a result 
of the exercise. It is important to use patients’ specific words in summarizing 
their thoughts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 686 (Number of characters: 136):
At the end of the session, summarize the main points of the entire 
session. As the sessions progress, ask patients to do the summaries.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 687 (Number of characters: 77):
Finally, 
exchange feedback about the session, skill, or progress of therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 688 (Number of characters: 94):
This is a time for 
you to encourage and motivate patients to continue working towards change.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 689 (Number of characters: 107):
TROUBLESHOOTING AGENDA SETTING 
In discussing agenda items, there are many pitfalls for a new CBT provider.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 690 (Number of characters: 71):
It is your 
responsibility to keep the discussion on track and focused.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 691 (Number of characters: 202):
To prevent unfocused 
discussion, gently guide patients back to the topic when they drift; emphasize key 
emotions, beliefs , and automatic thoughts; and often summarize and rephrase what 
patients say.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 692 (Number of characters: 162):
You can also discuss at the start of therapy that one of your roles is to 
keep sessions on track; so, you may, at times, need to shift the focus of conversation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 693 (Number of characters: 147):
Getting patients’ agreement on this point at the beginning helps them feel more 
comfortable if you need to redirect or interrupt later in therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 694 (Number of characters: 173):
Pacing is also a 
concern for providers, but prioritizing and collaboratively agreeing on agenda items 
and times can help you and the patient stay within the allotted time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 695 (Number of characters: 140):
When guiding 
the conversation with your patient, you can use a mix of close-ended or open-ended 
questions in response to time constraints.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 696 (Number of characters: 77):
Patients and providers sometimes have difficulty setting the agenda together.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 697 (Number of characters: 116):
Sometimes 
patients do not want to contribute to the agenda because of feeling hopeless or negative 
toward therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 698 (Number of characters: 109):
Occasionally, the patient may also be unfocused when setting the agenda 
(e.g., recount events of past week).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 699 (Number of characters: 165):
It is often necessary to educate the patient about 
therapy by clarifying what kinds of issues constitute agenda issues and how session time 
may be optimally spent.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 700 (Number of characters: 142):
65
ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 9
CBT suggests that change involves skill acquisition and not simply identifying 
distorted thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 701 (Number of characters: 257):
Therefore, recognizing an unhelpful thought can be 
enlightening, but you should also use session time to teach skills to address the 
problem (e.g., thought records, behavioral activation) and not simply discuss the issue 
with the patient or offer advice.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 702 (Number of characters: 100):
The process of skill acquisition is what sets CBT apart 
from “talk therapies” (supportive therapy).

OBJECTIVES 
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 725 (Number of characters: 256):
To understand how homework is introduced and used in brief CBT 
• To understand techniques for increasing homework utility and compliance 
What Is Homework, and Why Is It a Central Part of CBT? Homework is an essential and effective component of brief CBT.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 726 (Number of characters: 205):
Because of the condensed 
number of sessions in brief CBT, assignments such as readings, behavior monitoring, and 
practicing new skills should be given to the patient to practice and use outside sessions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 727 (Number of characters: 249):
Homework assignments facilitate patient skill acquisition, treatment compliance, and 
symptom reduction by integrating the concepts learned in sessions into daily life. Homework 
is a key mechanism for facilitating between-session work and progress.

--------------------------------------------------

When?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 729 (Number of characters: 31):
(Indications/Contraindications)

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 731 (Number of characters: 69):
The nature and frequency of 
assignments are left to your discretion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 732 (Number of characters: 186):
Consider patient characteristics when assigning 
homework, specifically, reading ability, cognitive functioning, cultural identity, level of 
distress, work/life balance, and motivation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 733 (Number of characters: 246):
During the beginning stage of therapy, suggest 
homework; but, as therapy progresses, encourage patients to generate their own between-
session activities. This helps them to continue to use skills outside therapy and after the 
end of treatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 734 (Number of characters: 362):
Some patients may be hesitant to participate in homework assignments, 
so it is your responsibility to be open to patient feedback about assignments, give reasons 
for each task, and personalize homework assignments for each patient. Also, patients may 
have a negative reaction to the word homework, which might prompt you to use practice 
or at-home exercises.

1.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 737 (Number of characters: 26):
One Size Does Not Fit All.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 738 (Number of characters: 38):
Always tailor assignments to patients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 739 (Number of characters: 160):
Their reading level; desire to change; cognitive 
functioning; and, even, stage of life determine how much and what type of homework 
assignment fits them best.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 740 (Number of characters: 143):
For example, a single, working mother who is also a full-time 
student may not have time to read a complete book as a bibliotherapy assignment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 741 (Number of characters: 76):
Assigning her a small part of the book or an article may be more reasonable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 742 (Number of characters: 61):
Breaking 
assignments down into smaller parts is also useful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 743 (Number of characters: 407):
Always consider the patient’s 
diagnosis and presenting problem when assigning homework and ask yourself:

68
ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 10
In-Session Example 10.1
“Can the patient handle this homework, and will it be beneficial to his/her growth?” 
“Could there be a negative result from this assignment; and, if so, is the patient prepared 
to handle it outside session?” 
2. Explain in Detail.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 744 (Number of characters: 190):
Knowing the reason for an assignment and how it relates to overall treatment goals 
help patients understand why they are doing the assignment and also may encourage 
him/her to complete it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 745 (Number of characters: 110):
Most patients are interested in how certain activities may 
improve their situation or relieve their symptoms.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 746 (Number of characters: 118):
Explain assignments in the context of 
treatment goals and the cognitive model to enhance patient buy-in to the tasks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 747 (Number of characters: 26):
3. Set Homework as a Team.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 748 (Number of characters: 276):
Involving patients in designing and scheduling homework increases the chances they 
will complete it. It is also important to get the patient’s agreement to complete the 
homework. Suggest homework assignments, and then ask the patient if you can help 
make adjustments to it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 749 (Number of characters: 32):
Ask, for example, the following:

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 750 (Number of characters: 141):
In-Session Example 10.2
“Do you think this is reasonable?”
“What would you change about the assignment?”
“Let’s do an example together first.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 751 (Number of characters: 43):
Then we can make changes if we need to.”
4.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 752 (Number of characters: 27):
Create a Win-Win Situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 753 (Number of characters: 534):
Do not scold a patient for not completing homework assignments, but also do not 
dismiss their value. If a patient does not finish homework, which is common, you may 
learn about the patient’s level of motivation, ability to follow-through, or level of distress 
(e.g., too depressed to complete it). Failure to complete homework is an opportunity 
for you to evaluate the patient’s reason for noncompliance. The patient may have been 
anxious about completing an assignment incorrectly or may question the utility of the 
assignment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 754 (Number of characters: 49):
These thoughts are helpful to discuss in session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 755 (Number of characters: 338):
5. Start Homework In-Session. In the first few sessions after assigning homework, do a few examples with the patient in 
session, when possible. This gives the patient a clearer picture of what is expected and 
allows questions that he/she might have about the homework. It also gives the patient 
an idea how long the homework will take.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 756 (Number of characters: 118):
In subsequent sessions, the patient may start 
the assignment with your assistance to troubleshoot questions about it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 757 (Number of characters: 46):
69
ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 10
6.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 758 (Number of characters: 401):
Ask About and Review Homework. To emphasize the importance of homework, always ask about and review 
homework the session after you assign it. If the patient did not complete 
homework, use session time, if possible, to complete the assignment, which may also 
help identify the aspects of the skill that need to be reviewed. If you do not review 
homework in session, patients may stop completing it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 759 (Number of characters: 39):
7. Anticipate and Prepare for Problems.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 760 (Number of characters: 154):
With the first few homework assignments, help problem solve the assignment 
by eliciting feedback about it and planning when and how it will be completed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 761 (Number of characters: 167):
Assignments can be scheduled for a particular day and time to overcome barriers, and 
foreseeable problems for completing the assignment at that time can be discussed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 762 (Number of characters: 168):
For 
example, if the patient’s behavioral activation is to walk for 15 minutes on Wednesday at 
4pm, discuss what to do if it rains or other factors prevent completion.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 763 (Number of characters: 80):
Agree upon and 
schedule a second option (e.g., using treadmill for 15 minutes).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 764 (Number of characters: 234):
USING SELF-HELP RESOURCES AS HOMEWORK 
Assigning the patient reading materials relevant to brief CBT presenting problems is a 
useful tool for brief CBT because it allows patients to read about their disorder or CBT 
between sessions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 765 (Number of characters: 117):
This emphasizes the self-management focus of CBT and can accelerate 
therapeutic progress and maintenance of changes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 766 (Number of characters: 86):
Reading materials may be websites, 
book chapters, or sections of CBT patient manuals.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 767 (Number of characters: 133):
Some common examples of CBT 
bibliotherapy are Mind Over Mood (Greenberger & Padesky, 2016) and Feeling Good 
Handbook (Burns, 1999).

HOMEWORK TROUBLESHOOTING 
Practical Problems
Occasionally, providers may encounter a patient who waits until the day before a session 
to do the homework.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 769 (Number of characters: 156):
This is problematic because certain assignments, such as monitoring 
automatic thoughts, are most effective and most accurate when completed in the 
moment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 770 (Number of characters: 284):
There are many reasons patients may put off doing homework; and your role is 
to explore these reasons in a proactive, nonjudgmental, nonpunitive way. Sometimes patients may simply forget to do homework. They may have a busy schedule 
or have trouble remembering to complete homework.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 771 (Number of characters: 146):
Using a calendar and scheduling 
time to do homework are useful in this situation and provide the opportunity for 
time-management skill building.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 772 (Number of characters: 102):
You can also work with the patient to download self-
management apps on his/her smartphone or tablets.

--------------------------------------------------

A few assignments described in this text might be difficult for some patients.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 774 (Number of characters: 303):
If a patient 
is having trouble completing an assignment because of the level of difficulty, it is your job 
to explain how to complete it and gauge the patient’s understanding. Some assignments 
may need to be broken down into smaller steps until the patient can fully grasp how it is 
to be completed.

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 10
Psychological Problems
Patients who don’t complete homework might have unhelpful thoughts 
about themselves, the homework assignment, or therapy that need to be 
addressed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 776 (Number of characters: 319):
In these cases encouragement, thought testing, and listing the advantages 
and disadvantages of doing homework may be useful. Though outside the scope of this 
manual, techniques, such as motivational interviewing (Rollnick, et al., 1999), may also be 
used to address the ambivalence a patient may feel about homework.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 777 (Number of characters: 94):
Patient perceptions 
of importance and confidence are very important for noncompliance issues.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 778 (Number of characters: 59):
Many patients have negative reactions to the word homework.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 779 (Number of characters: 130):
They may feel overwhelmed 
by the perceived time or energy it will take to complete or concerned that therapy is like 
schoolwork.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 780 (Number of characters: 584):
In giving homework, address any concerns the patient may have about time 
constraints; and explain how long each assignment should take, while working with the 
patient to generate reasonable tasks. If the patient dislikes the term homework, work with 
them collaboratively to select another label, such as practice, between-session progress, 
task, or experiment. Homework may be problematic for patients who are perfectionists or those who desire to 
please the provider because they may spend too much time on an assignment or be overly 
concerned about getting the “right answer.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 781 (Number of characters: 225):
Clarify that the exercise is not about getting the 
“right answer,” and that they should concentrate on recording real feelings and thoughts and 
not concern themselves with spelling, grammar, or appearance of the assignment.

Provider Homework Bias

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 783 (Number of characters: 513):
Although completion of homework is primarily the patient’s responsibility, sometimes your 
thoughts about an assignment or approach to homework play a role in noncompliance. Check your own thoughts about assigning homework, and determine whether there is 
anything you can adjust in your approach that could better encourage the patient. Ask 
yourself, “Is the assignment too difficult?,” “Did I explain the assignment thoroughly?,” or 
“Have I led the patient to believe that homework is unimportant to therapy?”

chunk 798 (Number of characters: 1):
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 799 (Number of characters: 134):
To learn methods for educating the patient about unhelpful thinking. What Is Unhelpful Thinking, and Why Is It Important in Brief CBT?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 800 (Number of characters: 435):
The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that three layers of unhelpful thinking exist in 
individuals struggling with psychosocial difficulties: automatic thoughts, intermediate 
beliefs, and core beliefs (depicted below in Figure 11.1). Figure 11.1 Layers of Unhelpful Thinking 
 
 
 

72
ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 11
Automatic thoughts are immediate internal reactions that occur in response to 
situations and/or events.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 801 (Number of characters: 376):
We are often unaware of automatic thoughts because of 
their almost instantaneous nature. Sometimes automatic thoughts are helpful, as they help 
us navigate our environments. However, automatic thoughts become unhelpful when they 
are attached to symptoms of psychopathology (e.g., social isolation, depression, anxiety, 
etc.) and negatively impact people's quality of life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 802 (Number of characters: 113):
One way that we gain insight about 
these automatic thoughts is by understanding our emotional reactions to them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 803 (Number of characters: 345):
Unhelpful thinking styles are distorted reflections of situations that are often accepted as 
true. In essence, these unhelpful thought styles are real-time manifestations of negative 
beliefs (i.e., about oneself, the world, and the future) that are triggered by situations or 
exaggerated by psychiatric symptoms (e.g., anxiety or depression).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 804 (Number of characters: 308):
Intermediate beliefs are attitudes or rules that a person follows in life that typically apply 
across situations (not situation specific as with automatic thoughts). Intermediate beliefs 
can often be stated as conditional rules: “If x, then y.” For example, “If I am thin, then I will 
be loved by others.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 805 (Number of characters: 110):
Individuals create these assumptions by categorizing the information 
they receive from the world around them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 806 (Number of characters: 114):
These rules guide thoughts and subsequently 
influence behaviors. Core beliefs drive rules and automatic thoughts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 807 (Number of characters: 236):
For example, the belief, “I am unlovable,” 
may be driving the conditional rule, If I am thin, then I will be loved by others, which may 
drive obsessive thinking about one’s appearance, excessive exercise, or disordered eating 
habits.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 808 (Number of characters: 117):
Core beliefs are often formed in childhood and solidified over time as a result of 
one’s perceptions of experiences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 809 (Number of characters: 197):
Because individuals with psychological disorders tend

EXPLAINING AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS TO YOUR PATIENT 
It is important for patients to understand he rationale for identifying automatic thoughts 
before gaining skills to address their own thoughts. Using the situation-->thought--> 
feeling triangle introduced in Module 7 (Orienting the Patient to Brief CBT) can be helpful 
in explaining automatic thoughts. Completing the triangle with the patients’ recent or 
current automatic thoughts can facilitate their understanding.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 831 (Number of characters: 93):
In-Session Example 11.1
Provider: “So, Pamela, how have you been feeling this week?”
Patient:

--------------------------------------------------

“Just really sad…as usual.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 833 (Number of characters: 271):
It seems like I’m always feeling that way.”
Provider: “Did anything in particular trigger this sad feeling this weekend?”
Patient: 
“Yes, I had to go to my cousin’s wedding; and it was really difficult because I  
 
 
started thinking about how I will never get married.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 834 (Number of characters: 60):
Provider: “Pamela, that’s what we call an automatic thought.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 835 (Number of characters: 156):
It’s something that

Figure 11.3 Example Patient Cognitive Model
 
ELICITING AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS It is important for providers to teach patients how to identify automatic thoughts during 
and outside of session. AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS IN SESSION
Be aware of patients’ hot thoughts during sessions. Hot thoughts are automatic 
thoughts that occur in combination with a change in emotion or mood. Hot thoughts are 
particularly poignant or strong thoughts that are often associated with unhelpful core 
beliefs and should be targeted in therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 843 (Number of characters: 130):
Hot thoughts and the accompanying situation 
and emotion are tracked on the first three columns of the thought record (see p. 81).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 844 (Number of characters: 396):
To identify which automatic thoughts are “hot,” listen for verbal cues, such as the language 
used in the thought (see Cognitive Distortion worksheet, p. 83), and watches nonverbal 
cues, such as increased volume of speech or fidgeting. Changes in facial expression, 
shifts in position, or hand movements can be helpful in determining whether a patient is 
experiencing an automatic hot thought.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 845 (Number of characters: 89):
Listening to tone, pitch, volume, and the pace of 
a patient’s speech is also beneficial.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 846 (Number of characters: 260):
When you notice these actions, this is an opportune 
time to bring it to the patient’s attention and assist them in identifying an automatic

76
thought associated with the shift in emotions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 847 (Number of characters: 194):
In these instances, you are 
simply an observer of the behavior and make a note of your observation to 
the patient (“You are speaking more loudly; what is going through your mind right 
now?”).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 848 (Number of characters: 57):
The patient then provides an explanation of the behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 849 (Number of characters: 90):
In-Session Example 11.3
Patient 
“My boss reprimanded me again yesterday” (sighs heavily.)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 850 (Number of characters: 169):
Provider: “Tell me more.”
Patient: 
“Well, we were at a meeting; and I had just made my presentation, and he  
 
 
said he had expected a better product for the client.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 851 (Number of characters: 50):
(voice gets softer,   
 
 
beings wringing hands).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 852 (Number of characters: 136):
Provider: “Your voice changed a little when you said that; tell me what is going   
 
 
through your mind right now?”
Example continued:

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 853 (Number of characters: 52):
Patient: 
“I just feel like a failure at everything.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 854 (Number of characters: 94):
My work has always been the one thing  
 
 
I was good at, and now I am failing at that, too.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 855 (Number of characters: 82):
Provider: “Let’s take a look at that line of thinking and the feelings it creates.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 856 (Number of characters: 95):
It   
 
 
seems that when that thought entered your mind, your mood changed very  
 
 
quickly.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 857 (Number of characters: 76):
Did you notice that?”
Patient: 
“Yeah, I guess it did upset me pretty fast.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 858 (Number of characters: 88):
You usually will also need to use specific questions to elicit an automatic hot thought.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 859 (Number of characters: 39):
These questions are found in Module 12.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 860 (Number of characters: 271):
AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS BETWEEN SESSIONS
In brief CBT, a principal characteristic is the work the patient does outside of session. Because identifying automatic thoughts is a novel concept to many, practicing outside of 
session will facilitate movement and change in therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 861 (Number of characters: 153):
In fact, Burns and Nolen-Hoeksema 
(1992) found that patients who completed homework had significantly better treatment 
outcomes than those who did not.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 862 (Number of characters: 117):
Practicing key skills between sessions allows session 
time to be used for new skill acquisition and troubleshooting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 863 (Number of characters: 127):
Initially, when a specific 
situation is brought up in session, always ask, “What was going through your mind at that 
moment?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 864 (Number of characters: 310):
This helps the patient build awareness of an automatic thought, both within 
and outside of session. ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 11

77
Because automatic thoughts may occur outside awareness, asking for a more 
detailed description of the situation is also helpful in pinpointing unhelpful 
thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 865 (Number of characters: 124):
For example, you could "take the patient back" to when it happened, 
using imagery (e.g., Where were you when this happened?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 866 (Number of characters: 26):
What time of day was it?).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 867 (Number of characters: 164):
If 
the patient reverts to past tense, remind them to tell the story in present tense to help 
bring back the thoughts and feelings that occurred in this situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 868 (Number of characters: 134):
With continued questioning, it is possible that there may be more than one automatic 
thought associated with a problematic situation.

--------------------------------------------------

Elicit and record all automatic thoughts 
given for a particular situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 870 (Number of characters: 235):
In-Session Example 11.4
Provider: “Craig, what else were you thinking during this phone call with your wife?”
Craig: 
“I was thinking that she knows how bad I feel for not coming to the party  
 
 
and she wants me to feel even worse.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 871 (Number of characters: 65):
Provider: “So you weren’t thinking only that they were using you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 872 (Number of characters: 252):
You were also   
 
 
thinking that they knew you felt bad, and they wanted you to feel worse?”
Craig: 
“Yes.”
Provider: “So, that is really three different thoughts that you were having that were  
 
 
creating feelings of anger?”
Craig: 
“I guess so.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 873 (Number of characters: 236):
Remember that a patient’s automatic thoughts should be the actual words or images that 
go through their mind. Patients (or providers) may often interpret or rephrase thoughts; 
however, the goal is to get unprocessed thoughts verbatim.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 874 (Number of characters: 164):
DECIDING WHICH AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS TO FOCUS ON
Once patients become aware of how many automatic thoughts they have, they may feel 
overwhelmed by their sheer number.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 875 (Number of characters: 54):
Uncovering one thought may lead to another and 
so on.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 876 (Number of characters: 150):
Therefore, it is important to focus on the most important automatic thoughts and 
the hot thoughts that are likely to bring about the greatest change.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 877 (Number of characters: 89):
There are several 
things patients can do once they have identified an automatic thought.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 878 (Number of characters: 209):
They can decide 
to focus on that thought, choose another thought associated with the situation, or move 
on to another topic if they feel that there is a more powerful thought that they would like 
to tackle.

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 11

78
ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 11
You can help the patient choose automatic thoughts to focus on by frequently 
checking: 
• Goals for this session 
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 880 (Number of characters: 374):
Patient’s agenda items and addressing those problems
• The importance of the thought chosen in reaching therapeutic goals
Another technique is to identify a few automatic thoughts and then rate them on a scale 
of 0-100, based on how intense the associated feeling is (rate the feeling from 0-100), 
and how much patient believes the thought (rate believability from 0-100).

--------------------------------------------------

This helps to 
quantify which automatic thoughts are most important.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 882 (Number of characters: 68):
The thoughts with the strongest 
ratings should be considered first.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 883 (Number of characters: 64):
Unhelpful automatic thoughts often fall into certain categories.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 884 (Number of characters: 61):
These are common 
"cognitive distortions" or thinking errors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 885 (Number of characters: 255):
Identifying patterns of cognitive distortions 
in the patient's thought records or speech is instrumental for choosing a hot thought, 
conceptualizing the case, and planning treatment. A patient often has one or two common 
patterns of unhelpful thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 886 (Number of characters: 166):
Identifying these patterns helps him/her identify them 
when they come up and provides you an opportunity to intervene on a thought triggered 
in multiple situations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 887 (Number of characters: 172):
Therefore, changing a particular thought that is part of an unhelpful 
thinking pattern (e.g., tendency to ignore the positive) may have multiple benefits for the 
patient.

chunk 889 (Number of characters: 403):
INTERMEDIATE BELIEFS
To identify an intermediate belief, you must first know how to recognize patients’ 
automatic thoughts. You can do this by identifying an automatic thought and then 
attempting to identify an attitude or assumption patients feel about themselves, the 
future, others, or the world. These assumptions can be identified by listening for themes 
in the patient’s thoughts and behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 890 (Number of characters: 159):
You can use several techniques to identify an 
intermediate belief: 
• Look for an intermediate belief that comes in the form of a patient’s automatic thought.

•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 892 (Number of characters: 186):

CORE BELIEFS
Throughout therapy, hypothesize core beliefs that may be underlying unhelpful 
behaviors and thoughts.

chunk 897 (Number of characters: 98):
These hypotheses aid development of the case conceptualization 
and treatment plan (see Module 4).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 898 (Number of characters: 136):
A belief that is likely to be core will appear in several 
different areas of the patient’s life (i.e., relationships, work, parenting).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 899 (Number of characters: 149):
If time permits in 
Brief CBT, after you have collected enough evidence to support the alleged core belief, 
present and discuss it with the patient.

chunk 903 (Number of characters: 82):
At this point, you can elicit earlier life experiences consistent with the belief.

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 12
Module 12: Challenging Unhelpful Thinking
OBJECTIVES
• To learn techniques for addressing unhelpful thoughts 
• To understand and manage potential difficulties using thought records 
What Are the Techniques for Challenging Unhelpful Thought Patterns, and Why Are 
These Techniques Important for Brief CBT? Several techniques can be used to challenge unhelpful thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1012 (Number of characters: 52):
Most are used in conjunction 
with a thought record.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1013 (Number of characters: 331):
Challenging thoughts and beliefs in a collaborative, Socratic way 
allows patients to use their own statements to counter unhelpful thinking. Generating 
counter-statements based on the data patients bring to session increases the believability of 
the thoughts/beliefs and, thus, the effectiveness of the counter thoughts/beliefs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1014 (Number of characters: 5):
When?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1015 (Number of characters: 31):
(Indications/Contraindications)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1016 (Number of characters: 597):
Typically, unhelpful automatic thoughts are the first targets in the cognitive component of 
CBT. Following the introduction of the cognitive model (see Module 7: Orienting Patient 
to Brief CBT), and skills for identifying automatic hot thoughts and their accompanying 
emotions (see Module 11: Identifying Unhelpful Thoughts), introduce techniques for 
challenging hot thoughts. These techniques should immediately follow the session on 
identifying hot thoughts, to build continuity and familiarity with the skill set and instill 
hope of change after identifying problematic thinking patterns.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1017 (Number of characters: 231):
Although intermediate and 
core beliefs will be challenged in advanced stages of therapy, the techniques are similar for 
challenging thoughts. Many techniques below can be used interchangeably for challenging 
thoughts or beliefs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1018 (Number of characters: 115):
Brief CBT session time is best used for modifying thoughts or beliefs 
that are tightly held and strongly believed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1019 (Number of characters: 4):
How?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1020 (Number of characters: 23):
(Instructions/Handouts)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1021 (Number of characters: 77):
Socratic questioning is a provider stance for questioning unhelpful thinking.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1022 (Number of characters: 195):
This process 
involves asking a series of open-ended, brief questions that guide patients to discover 
their idiosyncratic thoughts, feelings, or behaviors associated with a particular situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1023 (Number of characters: 252):
Socratic questioning is nonjudgmental but is based on the provider’s insight that the 
original premise of a thought or belief may be untrue; therefore, the questions are 
designed to expose the unhelpful thought or belief so that it may be challenged.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1024 (Number of characters: 64):
The Thought Record is the staple of cognitive work in brief CBT.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1025 (Number of characters: 363):
The first three columns 
(see Thought Record handout at the end of Module 11) are used for identifying troubling 
situations and the accompanying emotions and unhelpful thoughts. These three columns 
are used in conjunction with Module 10 in that when the situation-->thought--> feeling 
triangle is unfolded, it forms the first three columns of a Thought Record.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1026 (Number of characters: 43):
85
ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 12

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1027 (Number of characters: 83):
A seven-column Thought Record is used to challenge unhelpful thoughts and 
beliefs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1028 (Number of characters: 70):
Instructions for completing columns 4-7 are described in detail below.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1029 (Number of characters: 151):
Once a hot thought and its accompanying emotion have been identified and rated, the hot 
thought is questioned to generate evidence for and against it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1030 (Number of characters: 58):
Building evidence may be 
introduced in the following way:

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1031 (Number of characters: 92):
In-Session Example 12.1
Example: We have identified a thought that is very powerful for you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1032 (Number of characters: 53):
You rated this 
thought as 90 out of 100 for sadness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1033 (Number of characters: 100):
Before spending a lot of time and energy on this 
thought, I want to know whether or not it is true.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1034 (Number of characters: 237):
Often when people are depressed 
or anxious, they take thoughts like this at face value, without first asking whether they 
are true. Accepting thoughts like this as true would certainly lead to the symptoms 
you’ve been struggling with.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1035 (Number of characters: 169):
If I thought, “I am worthless and can’t do anything right,” I 
wouldn’t want to get out of bed in the morning either, and I would probably feel pretty 
hopeless and sad.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1036 (Number of characters: 97):
When we test a thought like this, we are going to generate evidence 
for and against the thought.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1037 (Number of characters: 79):
It is as though the thought were on trial, and you were 
a lawyer for the case.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1038 (Number of characters: 72):
Remember, you have to be able to prove the evidence you are 
generating.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1039 (Number of characters: 48):
So, now let’s see how your thought stands up....

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1040 (Number of characters: 111):
DEVELOPING BALANCED THINKING 
These instructions might be useful to help patients develop balanced thinking:
1.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1041 (Number of characters: 57):
Help the patient question automatic thoughts by asking:
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1042 (Number of characters: 49):
What evidence is there that this thought is true?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1043 (Number of characters: 1):
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1044 (Number of characters: 53):
What evidence is there that this thought is not true?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1045 (Number of characters: 1):
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1046 (Number of characters: 84):
What would I tell someone I loved who was in this situation and had these 
thoughts?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1047 (Number of characters: 1):
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1048 (Number of characters: 69):
If my automatic thought is true, what is the worst that could happen?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1049 (Number of characters: 1):
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1050 (Number of characters: 74):
If my automatic thought is true, what is the best thing that could happen?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1051 (Number of characters: 2):
2.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1052 (Number of characters: 94):
Once you and the patient have generated evidence, combine it to form a more 
balanced thought.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1053 (Number of characters: 88):
This thought will likely be much longer and more nuanced than the 
original hot thought.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1054 (Number of characters: 268):
In-Session Example 12.2
Example: Taking all this information (from columns 4-5) into consideration, what is a 
more balanced thought that more accurately reflects the facts? 

86
ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 12
You might want to ask the following questions:
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1055 (Number of characters: 98):
Taking the information into account, is there an alternative way of thinking 
about the situation?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1056 (Number of characters: 1):
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1057 (Number of characters: 65):
Can someone I trust understand this situation in a different way?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1058 (Number of characters: 173):
3. Rate the believability of the alternative thought between 0-100%. If the thought is not 
more than 50% believable, more work is needed to identify an alternative thought.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1059 (Number of characters: 42):
Go 
back to the evidence and keep working.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1060 (Number of characters: 699):
After the patient has generated an alternative 
thought, they should rate how much they believe the thought from 0-100% (0% = no 
belief at all, 100% = greatest belief). If the alternative thought is not rated at more 
than 50%, this may indicate that the patient has actually provided a more deeply 
rooted belief (as opposed to an automatic thought) as the initial automatic thought. It is important to recognize the difference between beliefs and automatic thoughts 
because patients have to be motivated to change their thinking during the cognitive 
restructuring process. This motivation to change is less likely to happen if patients don’t 
believe in the change that they are trying to make.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1061 (Number of characters: 2):
4.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1062 (Number of characters: 141):
Once a believable alternative thought is generated, re-rate the mood associated with 
the hot thought (0-100%) after reading the new thought.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1063 (Number of characters: 69):
Reducing a thought/belief 
to a rating of 0% is not a realistic goal.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1064 (Number of characters: 54):
Instead, a reduction of 30-50% often provides 
relief.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1065 (Number of characters: 71):
Often patients will generate new emotions from the alternative thought.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1066 (Number of characters: 92):
However, 
it is most important first to re-rate the old mood before generating new emotions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1067 (Number of characters: 120):
The same strategy of generating an alternative thought for an unhelpful thought is used 
when challenging a core belief.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1068 (Number of characters: 101):
Once the belief is identified, the evidence is weighed, and a 
new more balanced belief is generated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1069 (Number of characters: 117):
Highlight 12.1

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 12
TROUBLESHOOTING THOUGHT/BELIEF MODIFICATION

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1073 (Number of characters: 127):
Some patients can see the benefits of doing a Thought Record immediately, 
but others might need to be motivated to be engaged.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1074 (Number of characters: 218):
It is helpful to use positive 
reinforcement to praise the effort of completing a thought record, point out the sections 
completed correctly, and review skills for the sections completed incompletely or 
inaccurately.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1075 (Number of characters: 434):
If a thought record is assigned for homework, it must always be reviewed 
during the subsequent session. Taking session time to review the thought record 
emphasizes its importance to the patient. Introducing the Thought Record as an “experiment” helps alleviate any performance 
anxiety the patient may have about completing it and may generate interest (“Give the 
thought record a try this week, and we’ll see how it works for you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1076 (Number of characters: 64):
Let me know next 
session how the experience to complete it was.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1077 (Number of characters: 73):
That will help us decide whether or not 
this is a useful tool for you.”)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1078 (Number of characters: 403):
Occasionally, a patient will show disinterest in doing the Thought Record or get tired of it 
after a while. For instances like this, there are other ways you can suggest that the patient 
can continue to attempt the Thought Record: 
• If a patient complains of never having time to do a Thought Record when certain 
situations occur, suggest that they carry a blank Thought Record in a wallet or purse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1079 (Number of characters: 1):
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1080 (Number of characters: 99):
Patients can use their cell phone to record Thought Records or voice/audio record  
their thoughts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1081 (Number of characters: 1):
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1082 (Number of characters: 271):
If a patient has done the Thought Record for a while and is becoming disinterested, 
suggest doing a “mental” Thought Record, since they are familiar with the process. • Suggest reading old Thought Record that have similar situations and automatic 
thoughts of their own.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1083 (Number of characters: 1):
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1084 (Number of characters: 263):
The patient can verbally dictate a Thought Record to someone and have that person 
write it down. • Instruct the patient to incorporate completion of the Thought Record into their daily 
routine, either at the same time of day or in an easily accessible location.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1085 (Number of characters: 102):
There will not always be an immediate change to a patient’s mood after a Thought 
Record is completed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1086 (Number of characters: 55):
It might be necessary to assess why there is no change.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1087 (Number of characters: 194):
It could be 
attributed to the patient’s deeply rooted belief in the automatic thought, to an unchanged 
underlying core belief, or to additional automatic thoughts that have not been evaluated.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1088 (Number of characters: 93):
It is necessary to ask: Why was there no mood change after completion of the Thought 
Record?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1089 (Number of characters: 45):
These other questions will also be helpful:
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1090 (Number of characters: 48):
Have I described the situation in enough detail?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1091 (Number of characters: 1):
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1092 (Number of characters: 40):
Did I identify and rate the right moods?

Did I list multiple thoughts?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1097 (Number of characters: 185):
Do I need more information for each individual thought?

Thought Record?

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1099 (Number of characters: 84):
Do I believe the alternative thought? What other alternative thoughts are available?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1100 (Number of characters: 155):
If thought/belief testing is ineffective in reducing negative mood, you can also explore 
the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining a thought/belief.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1101 (Number of characters: 101):
As we know, there 
are many disadvantages to negative beliefs we have, but there are also advantages.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1102 (Number of characters: 82):
The patient’s perceptions of the advantages may be obstructing the change process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1103 (Number of characters: 153):
Understanding the function of the thought/belief for the patient may be useful in 
clarifying why certain thoughts/beliefs are resistant to modification.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1104 (Number of characters: 190):
The provider should 
evaluate both the advantages and disadvantages of a patient’s assumptions and beliefs 
but, in doing so, work to diminish the advantages and highlight the disadvantages.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1105 (Number of characters: 330):
Often, when working to modify thoughts and beliefs, the patient may find evidence that 
supports the negative belief instead of evidence that contradicts it. If there is a good 
amount of evidence to support that negative core belief, then problem solving, rather than 
thought testing, is an appropriate strategy (see Module 15).

chunk 1108 (Number of characters: 88):
2. Reinforce and make sure that the patient believes in the cognitive model being 
used.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1109 (Number of characters: 238):
3. Teach the Thought Record in two sections: (1) The first three columns; Situation, 
Automatic thought(s), and Emotion(s), and (2) the last four columns; Evidence 
for and against thought, Alternative response, and New rating of emotion.

--------------------------------------------------

Module 13: Behavioral Activation
OBJECTIVES 
• To understand the important clinical components and applications of behavioral 
activation strategies in brief CBT.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1153 (Number of characters: 1):
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1154 (Number of characters: 151):
To learn skills and techniques to effectively use behavioral strategies for positive 
patient change (especially related to increasing pleasant events)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1155 (Number of characters: 59):
What Is the Behavioral Connection, and Why Is It Important?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1156 (Number of characters: 183):
Behaviors represent the “B” in CBT interventions, and it is important that patients 
become aware of the connection between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors (see Figure 
13.1 below).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1157 (Number of characters: 99):
Patients may not be as aware of the impact that thoughts and emotions 
may have on their behaviors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1158 (Number of characters: 263):
For instance, helpful thoughts (e.g., “Today is going to be 
a great day”) may be related to more positive emotions (e.g., happiness, excitement, 
etc.) and subsequent behavioral engagement (e.g., socializing with others, completing 
meaningful activities, etc.).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1159 (Number of characters: 288):
On the other hand, unhelpful thinking (e.g., “My life will never 
get better”) may be linked to negative emotions (e.g., sadness, anxiety, frustration) and 
avoidant behavioral coping (e.g., social isolation, not going to work or attending school, 
not attending important family events).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1160 (Number of characters: 139):
Thoughts, emotions, and behaviors may influence 
each other at any given moment throughout the day, and this relationship is bidirectional.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1161 (Number of characters: 262):
Figure 13.1 Thoughts, Emotions, and Behaviors
  
Helping patients understand the connection between what they do (behavior), what they 
think, and how they feel can help them gain insight, increase motivation for change in 
therapy, and improve therapy outcomes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1162 (Number of characters: 229):
Just as it is important to understand how past 
experiences have impacted patients’ problems, it is equally as important to focus on 
things patients can do now to change their emotional experiences as they move forward 
in life.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1163 (Number of characters: 187):
However, it may be more difficult to influence behavioral change if patients are not 
aware of the connections between these three components of the cognitive-behavioral 
treatment model.

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 13
What Is Behavioral Activation, and Why Is It Important? Behavioral activation includes a set of procedures and techniques aimed at 
increasing patient activity and access to reinforcing situations that improve mood and 
functioning.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1165 (Number of characters: 692):
From this behavioral standpoint, depression, for example, contains a host of 
characteristics that function to maintain depressive affect (e.g., passivity, fatigue, feelings 
of hopelessness) and decrease the chance of adaptive coping by increasing avoidance. The key here is that difficulty with mood often serves to increase avoidance of adaptive 
coping, including pleasant events, which help to alleviate and avoid depression. Re-
introducing pleasant events (one form of behavioral activation) can serve to improve 
mood in many different ways - 1) reversing avoidance, 2) increasing physical activity, 3) 
increasing self-confidence and 4) increasing feelings of usefulness and purpose.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1166 (Number of characters: 195):
An important point for providers: Behavioral activation (alternatively referred to as 
increasing pleasant activities) consists of a host of possible behaviors including, but not 
limited to: 
1.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1167 (Number of characters: 81):
Reintroducing prior pleasant activities
2. Introducing new pleasant activities
3.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1168 (Number of characters: 408):
Active coping or mastery activities (e.g., taking some form of behavioral action) to 
alleviate or reduce a life stressor; examples of active/behavioral coping that are not 
pleasant-event driven include 
 
 Filing or getting taxes done 
 
 Cleaning out a messy closet 
 
 Calling an estranged family member The goal of active coping is to decrease stress through accomplishment or  
overcoming avoidance.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1169 (Number of characters: 5):
When?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1170 (Number of characters: 31):
(Indications/Contraindications)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1171 (Number of characters: 495):
Because of its relatively simple and straightforward approach, behavioral activation is 
a good technique for initial stages of treatment and can be highly effective for patients 
with limited insight into their difficulties. Activation is also easily measured (e.g., number, 
frequency, or duration of activities) and, therefore, can be used to document and convey 
progress to patients (e.g., to increase treatment investment and improve patient self- 
confidence and influence over symptoms).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1172 (Number of characters: 70):
Behavioral interventions are particularly powerful for depressed mood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1173 (Number of characters: 70):
Activation for 
depression generally serves to get the patient moving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1174 (Number of characters: 78):
Integrating pleasant activities 
can be effective in improving depressed mood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1175 (Number of characters: 60):
However, getting the patient to 
complete activities is key.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1176 (Number of characters: 108):
Almost all behaviors that include physical activity, planning, or 
accomplishing tasks are appropriate here.

(Instructions/Handouts)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1179 (Number of characters: 205):
STEP #1: PROVIDE PATIENT WITH RATIONALE FOR BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION. It is important to educate the patient as to what behavioral activation is and how it can be 
useful for improving depression and anxiety.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1180 (Number of characters: 320):
Let patients know that feeling a little down 
or having a bad day and not feeling well physically can make it more likely that they will 
stop doing many activities that used to be pleasurable. When this happens, patients can 
get into the habit of avoiding pleasant activities that might actually help them feel better.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1181 (Number of characters: 133):
It is also important for patients to understand the connection between what they do and 
how they feel, both mentally and physically.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1182 (Number of characters: 191):
You are encouraged to explain to patients that 
increasing activity and/or taking action, even when we do not feel like it, help us to feel 
better physically, as well as decrease depression.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1183 (Number of characters: 82):
Provider: I would like to talk a little about what your day looked like yesterday.

--------------------------------------------------

Well, in the morning I woke up at 10 am and ate breakfast.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1186 (Number of characters: 30):
I watched TV until  
 
 
noon.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1187 (Number of characters: 17):
Then I ate lunch.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1188 (Number of characters: 28):
Around 2:30 I took a shower.

How did you feel in the morning?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1192 (Number of characters: 16):
Patient:

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1193 (Number of characters: 62):
I just couldn’t get motivated and did not want to do anything.

--------------------------------------------------

I guess I  
 
 
was feeling sorry for myself – depressed, I guess.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1195 (Number of characters: 45):

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1205 (Number of characters: 105):
To

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 13
STEP #2: IDENTIFY BEHAVIORS – DISCUSS ACTIVITIES.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1210 (Number of characters: 118):
Identification of potential activities begins by exploring with the patient 
activities that would be most meaningful.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1211 (Number of characters: 628):
This may begin by having a general discussion 
about values that are important to the patient as well as goals that they may want to 
accomplish. Values clarification (i.e., identifying the most important things to patients) 
can help patients feel heard and convey the collaborative process of the therapeutic 
relationship. Explicitly identifying values may enhance a patient’s motivation to change 
and guide the identification of behaviors that the patient would be willing to engage in 
related to his/her values. Additionally, a patient’s values can help identify therapeutic goals 
to incorporate into the treatment plan.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1212 (Number of characters: 223):
Exploring targets for behavioral activation may begin with asking patients about 1) the 
types of things they would like to do but have not been able to do, or 2) activities they 
already do but would like to do more often.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1213 (Number of characters: 112):
It may be important to anchor these behaviors 
within the context of values or goals that are important to them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1214 (Number of characters: 122):
You might want to ask 
if there is something that they need to do that they have been unable to do or have been 
avoiding.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1215 (Number of characters: 192):
Although you want patients to do activities that are purely pleasurable to elicit 
positive mood, some patients may want to accomplish something rather than focus on 
doing something pleasant.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1216 (Number of characters: 235):
Possible questions might include: 
• “Can you think of any activities or hobbies that you used to enjoy doing but have now 
stopped doing?” 
• “Can you think of any activities or hobbies that you would like to do but have  
never done?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1217 (Number of characters: 63):
• “Are there things in your life that you would like to change?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1218 (Number of characters: 88):
If so, what would you like to 
do about these issues that you have previously not done?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1219 (Number of characters: 123):
For patients who have difficulty identifying activities, you can introduce a behavioral 
activity checklist (see Appendix).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1220 (Number of characters: 143):
Before completing the next steps (e.g., setting a plan), it is important to discuss the 
potential importance of the behavior with the patient.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1221 (Number of characters: 99):
If he/she reports low importance, 
encourage the patient to find another, more meaningful activity.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1222 (Number of characters: 28):
STEP #3: SET AN ACTION PLAN.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1223 (Number of characters: 402):
Once the patient has identified a meaningful activity to engage in, help shape this 
work into a meaningful therapeutic goal. Action plans are one mechanism for creating 
meaningful behavioral goals for therapy. Action plans in their most basic form stipulate 
the specific goal to be accomplished, defined in terms of observable and measurable 
characteristics and a timeframe for monitoring progress.

e. Skills that the patient might want to enlist to help reach the goal (e.g., relaxation skills, 
problem-solving skills, etc.)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1230 (Number of characters: 411):
STEP #4: MONITOR PROGRESS IN MOOD, MASTERY, AND CONFIDENCE. It is important to monitor the patient’s mood and feelings of mastery and confidence. Outcomes such as improvement in mood, mastery, or confidence can be best identified 
through homework assignments that ask the patient to document the frequency and use of 
the behavioral activity and any corresponding emotions or feelings of mastery or confidence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1231 (Number of characters: 301):
On the basis of this monitoring of outcomes, evaluate the action plan and the patient’s 
ability to work towards achieving goals. If problems arise, make changes accordingly (e.g., 
breaking down goals into smaller steps, determining patient perceptions of importance 
and changing goals accordingly).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1232 (Number of characters: 206):
Monitoring shows the patient that you continue to 
believe in the importance of the technique/exercise and also serves to further motivate 
many patients by increasing the effectiveness of the intervention.

duties, you can work with them to identify meaningful activities related to the prior 
occupation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1238 (Number of characters: 238):
In this case, the patient might benefit from volunteering at a university; 
providing consultation (e.g., over email or telephone calls); or volunteering for a local

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1258 (Number of characters: 379):
It is important to monitor anxiety and avoid behavioral activation procedures that 
further aid in the patient’s avoidance of fearful situations (e.g., presenting problem 
is avoiding interpersonal difficulties with spouse, and patient chooses to shop 
or be on the internet for pleasure but specifically when spouse is in the house to 
avoid confrontation/talking about issues).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1259 (Number of characters: 167):
The goal is to introduce behaviors that 
will facilitate improvements in the patient’s life, while not reinforcing avoidance of 
uncomfortable situations and emotions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1260 (Number of characters: 320):
For example, patients with anxiety symptoms 
often avoid situations out of fear of negative consequence occurring in response to 
engaging in a particular activity. Although behavioral activation can aid these patients, 
you must also understand that the activity itself is not reinforcing (pleasant) but 
rather feared.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1261 (Number of characters: 138):
It is only the resulting completion of the task that may generate positive 
affect (e.g., I faced my fear, and nothing terrible happened).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1262 (Number of characters: 225):
This response differs from 
depression in that depressed patients will often look at behavioral activation as a 
positive outcome in and of itself (e.g., "exercising is enjoyable," or "I love talking with 
my granddaughter").

chunk 1279 (Number of characters: 723):
Exposure Therapy in Brief CBT
OBJECTIVES
• To introduce exposure-based therapy and provide basic instructions for use within brief CBT
• To discuss advantages and limitations for using exposure-based interventions in brief CBT What Is Exposure Therapy? Exposure therapy is an approach commonly used to treat anxiety conditions (namely, 
panic, agoraphobia, social phobia, and specific phobias – such as animals, heights, flying, 
choking, and blood-injury-injection). Exposure therapy is defined by its systematic 
approach to confronting feared stimuli in the presence of a safe environment. Feared 
stimuli can be external (e.g., objects, activities, situations) or internal (e.g., feared thoughts, 
physical sensations).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1280 (Number of characters: 162):
The aim of exposure therapy is to reduce the patient’s anxiety 
response to feared stimuli and increase the patient’s ability to experience and tolerate 
anxiety.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1281 (Number of characters: 765):
The process includes creating a thoughtfully constructed hierarchy of feared 
stimuli organized by the patient’s reported degree of fear. The patient and provider 
systematically work their way up the hierarchy by exposing the patient to the feared 
stimuli with a variety of exposure exercises, allowing the patient to habituate to their 
anxiety over time. Exposure therapy is rooted in classical conditioning theory, which posits that fear, an 
emotion, becomes linked with previously neutral or unfeared stimuli through cognitive 
and emotional processes that result in associated symptoms of anxiety. Subsequently, 
anxiety becomes a conditioned behavioral response to these stimuli through the 
activation of fear and engagement in avoidance/escape behaviors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1282 (Number of characters: 446):
It is important to 
note that these previously neutral stimuli may be animate (e.g., spiders, clowns, people), 
inanimate (e.g., toilets, knives, numbers, places), situational (e.g., driving, darkness, 
feeling uncertain), cognitive (e.g., “impure” thoughts, memories of traumatic events, 
premonitions), or physiological (e.g., racing heart, feeling out of breath, flushed skin) and 
would not otherwise elicit a strong or intense fear response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1283 (Number of characters: 368):
Exposure therapy seeks to 
“undo” this prior associative learning by reducing the conditioned anxiety/fear response 
through repeated confrontation with the feared stimuli. Most importantly, the individual 
undergoing exposure therapy must learn to tolerate the fear while building self-efficacy 
within the context of processing emotional reactions (see Figure 14.1).

ELEMENTS OF EXPOSURE
Exposure therapy, typically delivered in 8 to 12 sessions in specialty mental health 
settings, is efficacious for anxiety disorders as well as other conditions such as obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Hofmann & 
Smits, 2008; Rauch, et al. 2012). Although exposure therapy requires adequate time for 
extinction, recent advances in treatment have shown that briefer formats of exposure 
therapy (e.g., four to six sessions) are effective for patients with anxiety and PTSD 
(Cigrang, et al. 2017). Exposure therapy is generally conducted using one or a combination of different types of 
exposure exercises:
• Imaginal exposure, or exposure to one’s own thoughts and mental images, may be 
used to help patients experience their most feared thoughts more fully.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1286 (Number of characters: 100):
Sometimes, 
imaginal exposure may be used as a first step toward a strongly feared in vivo exercise.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1287 (Number of characters: 136):
An example of an imaginal exposure is to have patients write a short story in which the 
things they fear the most eventually come true.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1288 (Number of characters: 234):
• Interoceptive exposure, or exposure to physiologic sensations associated with anxiety 
and panic symptoms, should be used to systematically “expose” patients to the most 
common somatic symptoms associated with their fear responses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1289 (Number of characters: 88):
This should be 
done in a controlled way to ensure the health and safety of the patient.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1290 (Number of characters: 193):
Interoceptive 
exercises may include simulation exercises and naturalistic activities to help patients 
increase their tolerance of physiologic bodily sensations without using safety behaviors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1291 (Number of characters: 300):
• In vivo exposure, or real-life exposure to feared objects or situations, may be used to 
help patients overcome anxiety and panic insomuch as they negatively impact their 
quality of life. In-vivo exposure is associated with reduced symptoms of anxiety and 
panic, PTSD, and OCD over the long term.

The information contained in this module provides an overview and 
basic strategies for using an exposure-based approach in a brief setting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1325 (Number of characters: 138):
However, these 
basic strategies may not be appropriate for specialty mental health settings dealing with 
more complicated presentations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1326 (Number of characters: 256):
Because brief approaches to psychotherapy are not 
appropriate for all clinical presentations, we encourage providers to use specific (and 
often more intensive) treatment protocols when facing more severe or complicated clinical 
presentations of anxiety.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1327 (Number of characters: 190):
For patients with less severe symptoms or when full protocols 
are simply not feasible – providers may consider the techniques in this chapter – while 
recognizing the potential limitations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1328 (Number of characters: 150):
Exposure interventions require appropriate provider technical expertise and adequate 
time for learning, reflection, and extinction of fear responses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1329 (Number of characters: 137):
Clinical situations in which 
these ingredients are not present should be approached carefully or with additional 
supports/alternatives.

--------------------------------------------------

Common Myths Related to Fear and Exposure
Introduction to Exposure Treatment
Actively inform your patients about the nature of exposure treatment (e.g., in-vivo, 
imaginal, or interoceptive exposures) and a rationale behind the approach.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1357 (Number of characters: 153):
It is important 
to communicate that exposure exercises will be done gradually, in a predictable manner, 
safely, and under your control as the provider.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1358 (Number of characters: 187):
Exposure therapy yields positive outcomes 
when done correctly and when the patient understands the rationale. Often, patients may 
feel that exposure therapy is daunting or overwhelming.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1359 (Number of characters: 159):
Regularly check-in with patients 
before and during the process to ensure that patients display high levels of self-efficacy to 
complete the exposure process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1360 (Number of characters: 286):
You should refer to other modules in this guide outlining 
other skills to address concerns that may impede success with exposure therapy (i.e., 
cognitive restructuring, relaxation). Receiving benefits from exposure therapy requires continued practice in-session and 
between sessions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1361 (Number of characters: 98):
The more the patient can complete exposure exercises, the more their 
fear will begin to decrease.

--------------------------------------------------

Habituating to fear is a learned process that has to be reinforced 
over time.

--------------------------------------------------

Myth
Fact
Anxiety is not very 
common. People with 
anxiety are weak.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1365 (Number of characters: 87):
Nearly one in five people experiences some type of anxiety 
disorder in any given year.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1366 (Number of characters: 36):
Anxiety and stress happen to us all.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1367 (Number of characters: 227):
Anxiety will get better 
over time if you just 
leave things alone. Anxiety and fear lead to avoidance, which maintains the 
response over time. Exposure and facing fears and anxiety 
are effective at reducing anxiety and fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1368 (Number of characters: 271):
Therapy for anxiety will 
take years. Most anxiety conditions can be treated effectively in 10-
12 weekly sessions. Anxiety reductions can often be seen 
within the first weeks of therapy, and some providers offer 
abbreviated treatment that involve four to six sessions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1369 (Number of characters: 55):
A panic attack can 
make you lose control 
or pass out.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1370 (Number of characters: 107):
Fainting usually occurs from a sudden decrease in blood 
pressure and is not associated with panic attacks.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1371 (Number of characters: 329):
Someone with anxiety 
should avoid situations 
that cause stress. Avoiding stress often leads to immediate reductions in 
anxiety but creates a host of additional problems, including 
avoidance and continued fear responses. Often, what feels 
natural (e.g., avoiding stress) actually turns out to maintain or 
make anxiety worse.

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 14
Collaboratively Building a Fear Hierarchy
Collaboratively building a hierarchy of feared situations and formulating a 
treatment plan are critical steps for exposure.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1373 (Number of characters: 308):
Leverage your patient’s daily 
symptom recordings (e.g., panic attack records, daily mood ratings, avoidance of stimuli 
reports) to facilitate a comprehensive fear hierarchy. The patient can use levels of anxiety, 
distress, or panic to identify a list of feared situations, animals, objects, or sensations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1374 (Number of characters: 127):
The 
patient should account or track distress over a period of time or use historical evidence to 
begin forming the hierarchy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1375 (Number of characters: 619):
You and your patient will work together to decide target stimuli for the exposure exercises 
in treatment, based on the patient’s presenting concerns, reported symptoms and case 
conceptualization. Once stimuli are chosen, work with the patient to create specific 
and detailed targets to base exposure exercises on, ranked by SUD (subjective units of 
distress) levels. These targets should be detailed enough for you to create an exposure 
exercise tailored to the patient’s fear. You should work to understand why the patient fears 
certain stimuli. For example, a patient may fear and avoid going to grocery stores.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1376 (Number of characters: 209):
The fear 
could be because the patient has social anxiety and fears embarrassment. Or, the patient 
could fear having a panic attack in the middle of the store in front of others and not being 
able to escape.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1377 (Number of characters: 192):
As part of the construction of the fear hierarchy, you must also attend to 
patient safety behaviors that contribute to the maintenance of anxiety and may undermine 
future exposure exercises.

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 14
INTERMEDIATE STEPS: EFFICIENT USE OF EXPOSURE
An exposure activity is essentially broken into a series of seven steps.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1380 (Number of characters: 229):
Exposure 
starts with a low-level feared exercise according to the fear hierarchy to prevent inducing 
a response too high for the patient to cope with and to increase the likelihood of the 
patient’s habituating to the response.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1381 (Number of characters: 507):
Providers should ensure that safety behaviors are 
accounted for and monitored during the exposure exercise. Before and after the exposure, 
collect fear/anxiety symptom ratings as well as the patient’s cognitive and emotional 
response to the exercise to correct unhelpful thinking or behaviors, and commend the 
patient for completing the activity. Following successful completion of the exercise, work 
collaboratively with your patient to move up the fear hierarchy until symptom remission is 
attained.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1382 (Number of characters: 52):
Repeated practice is critical for symptom remission.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1383 (Number of characters: 843):
Treatment Duration and Frequency
Exposure sessions may vary in terms of duration and temporal spacing as well as the 
level of involvement of the provider and/or significant others. Duration of treatment may 
be short or longer term. Shorter durations may include single sessions or abbreviated/
weekend treatments, but such work often uses longer sessions and may be facilitated 
through delivery in group settings where interpersonal learning is possible between 
patients. Temporal spacing of sessions may include the traditional one session per week 
over a period of four to six weeks (or more) but may also be spaced such that exposure 
is heavily weighted at the beginning—with high levels of provider involvement—and 
then tapered into less frequent sessions (greater spacing between sessions) and/or less 
involvement of the provider.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1384 (Number of characters: 127):
An exposure exercise is typically completed in session, and then the patient is instructed 
to complete more exercises at home.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1385 (Number of characters: 44):
The exercise consists of a series of trials.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1386 (Number of characters: 123):
Each trial 
consists of the same level of exposure to the fear stimuli, over a period of time, within 
the same time frame.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1387 (Number of characters: 123):
For example, the patient may complete 10 trials of sitting in a dark 
room for 20-second intervals within 15 minutes total.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1388 (Number of characters: 101):
Or, the patient may read an imaginal 
exposure script you both created three times during 15 minutes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1389 (Number of characters: 831):
Ultimately, by you in collaboration with patients in terms of their needs and preferences of 
the patient.
Attention to Safety Behaviors
Critical processes for exposure therapy require interoceptive and in vivo exposure as well 
as careful attention to the restriction of safety behaviors that undermine the exposure 
activity. Exposure requires that a patient tolerate and accept anxiety and fear rather 
than avoid it through compensatory strategies. For example, the goal of an exposure 
exercise is to learn to tolerate the distress associated with the feared stimulus. Other CBT 
skills such as cognitive restructuring and relaxation skills should not be used during an 
exposure exercise, as they can serve as “distractions” and may reduce the experience of 
the exposure itself, serving only to prolong or solidify the fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1390 (Number of characters: 182):
Additionally, the use of 
anti-anxiety medications (e.g., benzodiazepines) has been found to complicate and even 
negatively impact treatment outcomes both immediately and over time.

Steps of Exposure Exercise:
1. Choose exposure activity (e.g., interoceptive exposure, in-vivo exposure, imaginal 
exposure)
a. Imaginal exposure
i. Goal: Indirectly increase tolerance of a feared object or situation to allow a 
corrective learning experience through vivid imagination.
ii.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1396 (Number of characters: 148):
You choose this exercise when real-life exposure to that feared stimuli is not 
feasible or would be too intense for the patient to do at that time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1397 (Number of characters: 4):
iii.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1398 (Number of characters: 270):
Imaginal exposure consists of you and your patient writing a detailed scenario of 
the feared stimuli, in first person. The scenario should include vivid details that 
tap into the patient’s specific fears and include the worst possible outcome of 
the feared situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1399 (Number of characters: 70):
The patient reads the script completely as one trial of the 
exposure.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1400 (Number of characters: 3):

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1401 (Number of characters: 459):
Examples: Imagining standing on top of a skyscraper, imagining talking to a 
friend, imagining a traumatic experience from the past, imagining taking a plane 
ride, or imagining not locking the house door
b. Interoceptive exposure
i. Goal: Increase tolerance of a feared bodily sensation or physical response to 
allow a corrective learning experience.
ii. You would choose interoceptive exposures when the feared stimulus is 
experiencing a bodily sensation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1402 (Number of characters: 91):
The patient will build tolerance to a specific 
sensation with repeated exposure over time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1403 (Number of characters: 431):
In Session Example 14.1
 
Feared Sensation
Exposure Activity 
Racing heart
Jumping jacks, running in place, push-ups
Dizziness
Shaking head, chair spinning, twirling in place
Shortness of 
breath
Straw breathing, voluntary hyperventilation, 
stair climbing 
Derealization/
dissociation 
Staring at self in a mirror, voluntary hyperventilation, 
staring at a fixed point on the wall

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1404 (Number of characters: 399):
In vivo exposure 
i. Goal: Directly increase tolerance of a feared object or situation to 
allow a corrective learning experience in real life.
ii. Choose this type of exposure when the patient is ready to build tolerance in 
situations that are accessible in real life. These exposures can be conducted 
during the session but often will be planned for the patient to complete in 
between sessions.

chunk 1427 (Number of characters: 466):
For example, it is 
common for patients with blood-injury-injection phobias to experience a fainting response 
(a physiological reaction that is associated with increased heart rate and blood pressure) 
during exposure exercises. Prior to exposure exercises, counter measures or techniques 
such as applied tension strategies (tensing the large muscle groups) may be required to 
reduce heart rate and blood pressure spikes and, therefore, avoid a fainting response.

Involving Others
Significant others can have a positive or negative impact on the maintenance of fear and

chunk 1433 (Number of characters: 451):
Although others may provide invaluable support for a specific treatment plan, 
they may also serve to unknowingly maintain anxiety by providing safety and support 
during critical exposure work. Providers who directly involve significant others in anxiety 
management treatments must ensure that communication is effective. Others involved in 
the care plan must have appropriate psychoeducation about anxiety and fear and ways 
anxiety is maintained.

Problem Solving
OBJECTIVES
• To introduce problem solving and its potential use in psychotherapy 
• To learn how to apply problem-solving skills during brief CBT 
What is problem solving, and why is it important in therapy? Problem-solving techniques generally involve a process by which individuals attempt to 
identify effective means of coping with problems of everyday living. This often involves a 
set of steps for analyzing a problem, identifying options for coping, evaluating the options, 
deciding upon a plan, and developing strategies for implementing the plan.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1449 (Number of characters: 567):
Problem-solving strategies can be used with a wide range of problems, including 
depression, anxiety, anger and aggression, stress management, coping with medical 
illness, addiction, and relationship/family difficulties. Problem-solving techniques teach 
skills that aid the patient in feeling increased control over life issues that previously felt 
overwhelming or unmanageable. In this manner, problem solving can help with practical 
problem resolution as well as emotion-focused coping (e.g., increasing control, decreasing 
stress, and increasing hopefulness).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1450 (Number of characters: 5):
When?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1451 (Number of characters: 138):
(Indications/Contraindications) 
Thoughts and beliefs are challenged when a thought or belief is not true or a situation 
is unchangeable.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1452 (Number of characters: 383):
Alternatively, problem solving may be used when the root of an issue 
is a changeable situation; and the thoughts associated with the noxious situation might 
be accurate. Problem solving can be especially effective when a specific problem is able 
to be addressed and operationalized. A specific operationalized problem is one that is 
easily explained, identified, and/or measured.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1453 (Number of characters: 67):
Problem solving works best when a practical 
solution is available.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1454 (Number of characters: 186):
For example, a patient complaining of social isolation likely has 
potential solutions to this difficulty (e.g., calling a friend, joining a group, engaging in a 
socially driven hobby).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1455 (Number of characters: 64):
Examples of problems appropriate for problem solving include:
1.

chunk 1467 (Number of characters: 559):
(Instructions/Handouts) 
PROBLEM-SOLVING THERAPY (PST) In problem-solving therapy, it is important that you first educate the patient about the 
problem-solving strategies that will be used during sessions. To enable patients to use 
the strategies after therapy ends, teach them to carefully examine a problem, create a 
list of solutions, and make decisions about which strategies are appropriate for a variety 
of problems. General guidelines for using problem-solving strategies are as follows: 
• Training should be tailored and specific to each patient.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1468 (Number of characters: 1):

For example, Allison’s family would often drop by several times a week without calling 
beforehand and expect her to care for their children.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1485 (Number of characters: 211):
She enjoyed this but felt tired 
many times and was beginning to get concerned about her ability to continue child 
sitting at such a frequent pace. Her first idea was to tell them she could no longer 
baby-sit.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1486 (Number of characters: 162):

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 16
Module 16: Relaxation
OBJECTIVES
• To understand the concept and importance of relaxation in brief CBT
• To acquire specific relaxation skills (e.g., muscle relaxation, deep breathing, imagery) What Are Relaxation Techniques, and Why Are They Important? Relaxation techniques consist of a collection of psychotherapeutic techniques designed 
to reduce tension, stress, worry, and/or anxiety. Relaxation techniques vary in their focus 
(e.g., physical sensations or changes in cognition/thoughts) and can be selected based 
on presenting difficulties, as well as patient preferences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1541 (Number of characters: 145):
Some patients respond to 
physical procedures (e.g., muscle relaxation and/or deep breathing), while others respond 
favorably to guided imagery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1542 (Number of characters: 74):
Relaxation techniques are important for brief therapy for several reasons.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1543 (Number of characters: 602):
First, they focus 
on skills that alleviate stress, anxiety, worry, and tension that are often debilitating and 
interfere with patient functioning. Second, stress, anxiety, worry, and tension are often 
very uncomfortable for patients; and providing help to alleviate distress can go a long way 
towards increasing positive treatment expectations and rapport. Relaxation techniques 
are easily conveyed as a method of increasing control and often do not include a direct 
discussion of mental health difficulties, which can be important for some patients who are 
concerned about mental health stigma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1544 (Number of characters: 70):
Finally, relaxation techniques are generally easy 
to teach and learn.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1545 (Number of characters: 158):
For these reasons, it is often advantageous to teach these techniques 
early in treatment to give patients an easy-to- learn, yet highly effective, skill set.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1546 (Number of characters: 5):
When?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1547 (Number of characters: 31):
(Indications/Contraindications)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1548 (Number of characters: 133):
As indicated, relaxation techniques are quite effective early in treatment to reduce tension 
and increase early treatment successes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1549 (Number of characters: 91):
They generate increased self-efficacy, perceived 
control over stress, and improved coping.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1550 (Number of characters: 444):
Examples of applications might include daily relaxation exercises to reduce an overall 
sense of tension or stress not affiliated with any specific situation (e.g., general worry 
or apprehension) or the use of relaxation techniques to manage work-related stress in 
preparation for an upcoming social or family event. Relaxation procedures can also be appropriate for persons with depressive symptoms to 
increase their perceptions of control.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1551 (Number of characters: 103):
However, it might not be appropriate for depressive 
symptoms occurring outside comorbid anxiety/worry.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1552 (Number of characters: 188):
For example, teaching a severely 
depressed person, who is experiencing fatigue and lack of motivation, to relax would not 
be useful unless the patient has a specific need for relaxation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1553 (Number of characters: 253):
Additionally, relaxation 
techniques might not be appropriate for patients with anxiety and panic symptoms as 
they may use them as avoidance behaviors. Use of relaxation when faced with feared 
stimuli can reinforce anxiety and further exacerbate fear.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1554 (Number of characters: 214):
120
ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 16
Relaxation techniques are appropriate for persons with chronic pain, 
migraines, and insomnia, as well as in smoking cessation treatment and 
weight management programs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1555 (Number of characters: 136):
These techniques can aid in symptom reduction 
and underlying issues that make it difficult for patients to cope with physical ailments.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1556 (Number of characters: 113):
However, it is important to consider how various relaxation techniques are impacted by 
any physical limitations.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1557 (Number of characters: 4):
How?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1558 (Number of characters: 23):
(Instructions/Handouts)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1559 (Number of characters: 253):
Regardless of the actual relaxation technique, it is imperative that the physical 
environment be attended to so as to maximize results. Before beginning relaxation 
techniques, it is suggested that you create a safe, quiet, and comfortable environment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1560 (Number of characters: 71):
You are encouraged to work with patients to create such an environment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1561 (Number of characters: 159):
Patients may be 
comfortable with certain recommendations (e.g., unfolding arms) but may be uncertain 
or uncomfortable with others (e.g., closing their eyes).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1562 (Number of characters: 112):
The following list of options can be 
used to create an effective atmosphere for relaxation-based interventions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1563 (Number of characters: 173):
Setting up the room: 
• Comfortable chair (a high-backed chair to support the patient’s neck, if possible) 
• Safe and relaxing room (e.g., temperature, noise, and lighting)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1564 (Number of characters: 80):
Highlight 16.1
Other tips to increase stress-management effectiveness include:
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1565 (Number of characters: 206):
Having the patient loosen tight clothing (collars, belts, shoes, etc.) or remove glasses
• Having the patient sit in a comfortable fashion (e.g., uncrossing arms and legs, 
placing feet flat on the floor)
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1566 (Number of characters: 62):
Dimming the lights or removing bright sunshine from the room
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1567 (Number of characters: 103):
Having patients close their eyes
• Asking patients whether they need a bathroom break before starting
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1568 (Number of characters: 212):
Asking patients to clear their mind and focus on your voice and instructions
The following sections of this module addresses three specific techniques: progressive 
muscle relaxation, deep breathing, and imagery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1569 (Number of characters: 166):
You largely determine selection of a 
specific technique, but you should select it with the patient's expressed interests and 
learning preferences/abilities in mind.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1570 (Number of characters: 106):
For example, patients who are largely somatically 
focused may prefer muscle relaxation or deep breathing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1571 (Number of characters: 146):
Other patients, especially those 
who appreciate the association between thoughts and mood, might be best served using 
guided imagery procedures.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1572 (Number of characters: 136):
However, the ultimate decision of which procedure to use 
may relate to exposure to all three techniques and a trial-and-error approach.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1573 (Number of characters: 297):
121
ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 16
PROGRESSIVE MUSCLE RELAXATION (PMR)
PMR consists of learning how to tense and then relax various groups of muscles 
all through the body in a sequential fashion, while paying close attention to the feelings 
associated with both tension and relaxation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1574 (Number of characters: 152):
Although muscle relaxation has been around 
for many years, it has become more popular recently for dealing with different anxiety and 
panic disorders.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1575 (Number of characters: 212):
With this procedure, the patient learns how to relax and how to recognize 
and pinpoint tension and relaxation in the body to identify tension and reduce its influence 
before each reaches high levels/impairment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1576 (Number of characters: 153):
In teaching patients muscle relaxation, you should first explain the reason for using 
muscle relaxation and how it will benefit the patient (rationale).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1577 (Number of characters: 77):
You should also give a full 
explanation and demonstration of how it is done.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1578 (Number of characters: 299):
Step #1: PMR Increases Control. Introduce PMR principles and procedures. PMR begins by letting patients know that they 
can create sensations of relaxation and that this process of “inducing” relaxation begins by 
being able to identify and discriminate between sensations of tension and relaxation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1579 (Number of characters: 57):
Step #2: Note the Incongruence of Tension and Relaxation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1580 (Number of characters: 92):
Inform the patient that sensations of tension and relaxation cannot occur at the same 
time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1581 (Number of characters: 66):
No muscles in the body can be tensed and relaxed at the same time.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1582 (Number of characters: 130):
This principle 
is critical, and you should ensure that patients fully understand how this applies to their 
current difficulties.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1583 (Number of characters: 36):
Step #3: Identify States of Tension.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1584 (Number of characters: 214):
Explain to the patient that tension often builds gradually without conscious awareness. Learning to detect the initial signs of an increase is an important step towards avoiding 
a full-blown occurrence of tension.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1585 (Number of characters: 172):
Inform patients that, no matter the level of intensity, 
they can stop and reverse the tension using knowledge of PMR – in essence, it is never too 
late to reduce tension.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1586 (Number of characters: 124):
Over time patients become increasingly skilled at identifying stress 
earlier and earlier (e.g., their awareness increases).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1587 (Number of characters: 29):
Step #4: Tense Muscle Groups.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1588 (Number of characters: 152):
Highlight 16.2
A brief word of caution: If at any point during the technique a patient experiences pain, 
alter or completely discontinue the technique.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1589 (Number of characters: 154):
If the patient experiences chronic pain in 
any part of the body, it is best to avoid the tensing component when the patient gets 
to those muscle groups.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1590 (Number of characters: 157):
PMR asks the patient to tense and release different muscle groups in sequence, moving 
from the arms to the face, neck, chest and shoulders, torso, and legs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1591 (Number of characters: 128):
For each specific 
muscle group, it’s important to try to tense only that muscle group during the tensing part 
of the exercise.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1592 (Number of characters: 112):
Throughout the procedure, it is important to concentrate on the sensations 
produced by the different exercises.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1593 (Number of characters: 139):
Asking the patient to describe bodily sensations is 

122
ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 16
very important for the learning process.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1594 (Number of characters: 97):
Statements or phrases from you might 
include: “What are you noticing about your body right now?”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1595 (Number of characters: 94):
These questions 
help the patient to focus on the way the body “feels” when tense and relaxed.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1596 (Number of characters: 50):
TENSING INSTRUCTIONS
Model each tension procedure.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1597 (Number of characters: 50):

Step #5: Debrief After the Exercise.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1619 (Number of characters: 110):
After relaxation training, question the patient about his or her reaction to the muscle- 
relaxation exercise.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1620 (Number of characters: 68):
It is also important to make any adjustments needed to the training.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1621 (Number of characters: 112):
Monitor any pain the patient experienced to adapt and improve the technique for the 
individual patient’s needs.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1622 (Number of characters: 46):
Step #6: Continue to Practice Outside Session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1623 (Number of characters: 133):
It will be important for the patients to practice PMR at least once a day over the first week 
or two to build skills and confidence.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1624 (Number of characters: 127):
As they become increasingly skilled at PMR, they 
might find it possible to relax without having to actively tense the muscles.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1625 (Number of characters: 98):
The patients 
should use regularly scheduled homework to practice in a nondistracting environment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1626 (Number of characters: 157):
When they have learned to relax in a calm environment, it should be easier to relax in more 
distracting situations, whenever they notice tension developing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1627 (Number of characters: 239):
123
DEEP-BREATHING TECHNIQUE 
Another physiological-based relaxation technique is deep breathing. Deep 
breathing focuses on reducing rapid and shallow (ineffective) breathing that often occurs 
during periods of stress, worry, or anxiety.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1628 (Number of characters: 314):
Rapid and shallow breaths can lead the patient 
to have decreased oxygen in the system, which can cause hyperventilation, dizziness, 
lightheadedness, or decreased ability to concentrate. Alternatively, taking a deep, full 
breath can produce a feeling of calmness or slowing by increasing oxygen-rich blood 
flow.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1629 (Number of characters: 111):
It can also strengthen muscles in the chest and stomach, which can make it easier to 
breathe on a daily basis.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1630 (Number of characters: 181):
STEPS TO DEEP BREATHING: Step #1: Introduce the patient to Deep Breathing. Indicate why Deep Breathing was 
chosen, and provide an overview of the procedures and potential benefits.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1631 (Number of characters: 148):
Step #2: Ask the patient to put one hand on the abdomen, with the little finger about one 
inch above the navel, and to place one hand on the chest.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1632 (Number of characters: 208):
Step #3: Ask the patient to pay attention to their breathing (pause for several seconds to 
allow the patient the opportunity to assess breathing) and then to tell you which hand is 
doing more of the moving.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1633 (Number of characters: 96):
Ideally, the hand on the abdomen should be moving; while the 
hand over the chest remains still.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1634 (Number of characters: 39):
This ensures that the breaths are deep.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1635 (Number of characters: 156):
Step #4: Work with the patient to take deeper breaths by getting the hand over the 
stomach to move while having little movement of the hand over the chest.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1636 (Number of characters: 102):
Inform the 
patient, ”Your hand on your diaphragm should move out as you inhale and in as you exhale.”

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1637 (Number of characters: 20):
Highlight 16.3
NOTE:

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1638 (Number of characters: 82):
Patients with a lung or heart condition might have difficulty with deep breathing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1639 (Number of characters: 105):
If patients report difficulty, slow the process down and help them to maximize the 
exercise comfortably.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1640 (Number of characters: 106):
Step #5: To pace the patient, you might suggest saying the words in and out slowly, while 
taking breaths.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1641 (Number of characters: 85):
Inhalations and exhalations should build to approximately three seconds 
in duration.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1642 (Number of characters: 89):
Step #6: Ask patients if they notice any changes in breathing and feelings of relaxation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1643 (Number of characters: 45):
Ask for general feedback about the technique.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1644 (Number of characters: 208):
Step #7: Repeat the breathing exercise three or more times until the patient reports skill 
understanding and benefit. Step #8: Ask the patient to identify situations when deep breathing might be appropriate.

Step #9: Continue practice outside of session.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1646 (Number of characters: 143):
Work with the patient to set 
a homework assignment that encourages application of Deep Breathing to 
situations when the patient feels stress.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1647 (Number of characters: 86):
Highlight 16.4
Other tips for Deep Breathing:
1. Inhale through nose and out of mouth.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1648 (Number of characters: 72):
2. Ask patient to purse lips (as if blowing on hot soup) while exhaling.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1649 (Number of characters: 44):
3. Do not pause between inhales and exhales.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1650 (Number of characters: 49):
4. Ask patient to close eyes during the exercise.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1651 (Number of characters: 2):
5.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1652 (Number of characters: 66):
Patient may want to use mantra such as “relax” during each exhale.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1653 (Number of characters: 256):
6. Pair up deep breathing with imagery once the patient has begun to master 
breathing skills. 7. Point out that deep breathing is a portable skill that can be used in a variety of 
situations and relatively without notice of others (PMR is less portable).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1654 (Number of characters: 253):
IMAGERY
Imagery is a cognitive relaxation technique that can be used to ease stress and promote 
an overall sense of well-being. Imagery focuses on increasing cognitive, emotional, 
and physical control by changing the focus of an individual’s thoughts.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1655 (Number of characters: 94):
We all have 
daydreamed about pleasant things that have distracted us and made us feel better.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1656 (Number of characters: 1228):
Imagery uses much the same process but encourages positive adaptive “dreaming” that 
distracts and relaxes the individual. Imagery is highly effective for depression and anxiety, 
as well as specific situations that require clarity, focus, distraction, or feelings of mastery. The following are examples:

How Guided Imagery Works 
Research has shown that the mind can affect how the body functions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1657 (Number of characters: 85):
It seems 
the body may not know the difference between an actual event and a thought.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1658 (Number of characters: 218):
Guided imagery uses the power of the brain—images and the perception that you are 
either somewhere else or in a different state of mind—to increase pleasant experiences 
and performance to promote wellness and health.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1659 (Number of characters: 127):
On the flip side, imagery helps to reduce 
stress tension and anxiety by changing thoughts and emotions or through distraction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1660 (Number of characters: 296):
Imagery is commonly referred to as guided imagery. Guided imagery refers to a process 
whereby you facilitate or guide the initial images the patient uses. The following section 
describes how you can guide the patient into the effective use of imagery for relaxation or 
performance improvement.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1661 (Number of characters: 27):
Step #1: Introduce Imagery.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1662 (Number of characters: 165):
Introduce imagery to the patient, pointing out the power of the brain or thoughts and how 
images, when accessed correctly, can change physical and emotional states.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1663 (Number of characters: 98):
Step #2: Identify the Desired Outcomes, Such as Decreased Anxiety,  
Increased Focus, Distraction.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1664 (Number of characters: 35):
Step #3: Develop an Image or Scene.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1665 (Number of characters: 194):
Work with the patient on the third step to identify a situation, either in the past or a 
desirable place to be, that both you and the patient feel might benefit or produce the 
desired outcome.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1666 (Number of characters: 119):
Sample imagery scripts are provided below and can be used if the patient 
has difficulty creating a personal situation.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1667 (Number of characters: 76):
Selection of a powerful image is critical to the 
success of this technique.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1668 (Number of characters: 253):
Selection of an image that the patient is able to fully embrace 
increases the odds of treatment success. Selection of a “weak” image (e.g., not viewed as 
important by the patient or unable to be fully visualized) will likely lead to treatment failure.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1669 (Number of characters: 41):
Step #4: Increase Vividness of the Image.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1670 (Number of characters: 130):
To ensure that patients find a “strong” image, ask them to explore as many senses as 
possible to increase vividness of the image.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1671 (Number of characters: 217):
For example, when imagining a glass of 
lemonade, imagine holding a glass that feels icy and cold; visualize the color of the 
lemonade; think of the fresh citrus smell; and, finally, think of how the lemonade tastes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1672 (Number of characters: 94):
This 
is an example of imagery that uses multiple senses and increases vividness of the image.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1673 (Number of characters: 91):
Increasing vividness is largely a matter of increasing the details the patient experiences.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1674 (Number of characters: 75):
The more details described by the patient, the more powerful the technique.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1675 (Number of characters: 76):
Step #5: Ask Patients if They Notice Any Changes After the Imagery Exercise.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1676 (Number of characters: 46):
Ask for 
general feedback about the technique.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1682 (Number of characters: 46):
Pair up imagery with deep-breathing exercises.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1683 (Number of characters: 71):
2. Ask patient to close eyes during the exercise to increase vividness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1684 (Number of characters: 91):
3. Interject during the imagery experience aspects that you feel might benefit the patient.

--------------------------------------------------

BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 16

SPECIAL POPULATIONS CHAPTER  |  MODULE 17
Module 17: Adaptation of bCBT for Special Clinical Populations
OBJECTIVES
• To recognize cultural and diagnostic components associated with clinical populations
• To understand clinical considerations of specific clinical populations
• To learn how to adapt brief CBT for specific clinical populations
Introduction
Introduction
Special clinical populations present unique life experiences, therefore requiring a 
therapeutic approach that understands this uniqueness and appreciates the context 
of the individual when engaging in clinical interventions. We describe four general 
clinical populations that may require more critical analysis of how best to apply brief 
CBT techniques.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1770 (Number of characters: 440):
Military Populations
Military personnel face unique and often intense physical and psychological challenges 
when serving their country. A 2014 research article (JAMA Psychiatry, 2014) found 
that one in four active duty military personnel had signs indicating the presence of a 
mental health condition. Common mental health disorders in military populations include 
depression, anxiety, substance abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1771 (Number of characters: 65):
Individuals may 
also face physical health changes due to injury.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1772 (Number of characters: 302):
Common somatic and emotional health 
symptoms may include chronic pain, insomnia, and anger management difficulties. Notably, somatic symptoms may be related to emotional health difficulties; and substance 
abuse issues may “mask” other mental health difficulties – especially those related to 
trauma.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1773 (Number of characters: 305):
Finally, military personnel are at increased risk of suicide regardless of service era 
– but personnel from the recent Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts have been found to have 
high rates (20% or greater) of traumatic brain injury (TBI), which further elevates mental 
health difficulties and suicide risk.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1774 (Number of characters: 913):
While on active duty, military personnel often face challenges that range from mild 
but chronic stressors (e.g. requiring to be “on guard” while in combat environments 
regardless of actually being in conflict) to acute and severe stressors (e.g. physical injury 
or death or injury to a colleague or civilians). Although combat stressors are commonly 
associated with increased stress and mental health demands, other aspects of military 
life create challenges that may include post deployment reintegration into civilian life, 
social isolation, or possibly even severe non combat trauma such as military sexual assault. Regardless of the specific stressors or “triggering events,” it is important to recognize that 
not all military personnel require mental health services. However, many military personnel 
will face mental health challenges that do not reflect weakness on the part of the service 
member.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1775 (Number of characters: 226):
These challenges must also be understood within the context of the service 

130
member’s home and/or social environment to fully appreciate the impact and 
potential sources of support to address any mental health conditions.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1776 (Number of characters: 611):
THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS AND ADAPTATIONS
Providers are encouraged to explore the meaning of military service and the possible 
relationship between military service, military-related stressors, and resiliency factors. Military culture may play a significant role in the way in which service members approach 
mental health treatment. For example, military culture places a premium on strength and 
resilience, which may be at odds with help-seeking behaviors. In some instances, emphasis 
on strength and resiliency may lead to social isolation and/or limited sharing of emotional or 
psychological struggles.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1777 (Number of characters: 204):
Additionally, service members may face ramifications for seeking 
help that impact their careers such as pilots no longer being allowed to fly or security forces 
no longer being allowed to carry weapons.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1778 (Number of characters: 140):
Stigma around seeking help can carry over for 
Veterans if they continue to work in national security positions as civilians or contractors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1779 (Number of characters: 225):
For all service members and Veterans, providers must attend to suicidal ideation and/or 
plans and should be prepared to actively manage these concerns using a comprehensive 
suicide assessment and safety plan (where needed).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1780 (Number of characters: 103):
Importantly, this population tends to 
have greater access to firearms and lethal means than civilians.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1781 (Number of characters: 97):
Providers should know their 
state laws for how to ensure lethal means safety for at risk groups.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1782 (Number of characters: 180):
POTENTIAL BRIEF CBT ADAPTATIONS 
Providers may wish to consider the following adaptations to their traditional CBT 
approaches when working with military personnel and Veterans:
1.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1783 (Number of characters: 417):
Integration of prior military experiences. For military personnel who strongly relate 
to their current and prior military service, providers are encouraged to explore the 
patient’s military experiences for examples of challenges, coping, and successes. These examples may provide valuable information for treatment planning while also 
helping in understanding the patient’s military context and developing rapport.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1784 (Number of characters: 2):
2.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1785 (Number of characters: 35):
Peer support and social connection.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1786 (Number of characters: 151):
Given the elevated potential for suicide, social 
isolation can be a critical contributing factor to the maintenance of emotional 
health difficulties.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1787 (Number of characters: 76):
Many military personnel place a high value on service, family, and 
country.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1788 (Number of characters: 217):
Although they do not want to be a burden on others, they are often willing 
to consider the value of others in their lives and the need to connect (re-connect) 
through the encouragement of a planned therapeutic plan.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1789 (Number of characters: 32):
3. Romantic relationship status.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1790 (Number of characters: 97):
Among military members, relationship problems 
are among the most common antecedents for suicide.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1791 (Number of characters: 125):
Routinely monitoring 
relationship status is important and can signal any acute mental health status 
changes that may arise.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1792 (Number of characters: 2):
4.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1793 (Number of characters: 167):
Attending to physical health and functional changes. Many military personnel will 
face physical and/or functional health changes that require lifestyle modifications.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1794 (Number of characters: 99):
Many of these challenges push patients away from activities that previously brought 
them pleasure.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1795 (Number of characters: 279):
Providers are encouraged to consider these prior activities (and 
the losses) the military member is now facing, and then identify new activities, 
SPECIAL POPULATIONS CHAPTER  |  MODULE 17

131
especially social activities, where possible, that remain available to the 
patient.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1796 (Number of characters: 358):
For example, a patient who had been runner who is now no longer 
physically able to run may identify meaning in being outdoors, being with others 
during early morning runs, or feeling a sense of accomplishment. Although running is 
no longer possible, activities that are outdoors, involve others, and provide as sense 
of accomplishment are often possible.

Older Adult Populations
Older adults, particularly those ages 65 and up, represent a unique population that often 
face life circumstances and challenges related to work and retirement and changes in 
family dynamics or living arrangements, as well as increased attention to physical health 
conditions including changes in cognition and memory.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1798 (Number of characters: 136):
These changes may include 
physical or functional changes but many individuals will face these challenges especially 
with advanced age.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1799 (Number of characters: 202):
Older adults are at increased risk for social isolation and suicide, and 
these issues are further complicated when combined with a physical illness or changes in 
cognitive functioning (e.g. dementia).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1800 (Number of characters: 59):
POTENTIAL ADAPTATIONS TO CBT FOR OLDER ADULT POPULATIONS
1.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1801 (Number of characters: 26):
Speed and pace of therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1802 (Number of characters: 473):
Older adults, especially those new to psychotherapy, 
are likely to benefit from a pace of therapy that meets their emotional and cognitive 
needs. As a population, older adults vary greatly in their functional and cognitive 
abilities, and you must be prepared to adapt your approaches accordingly. Some 
older adults will require no modifications while others will need a pace and speed of 
therapy that are slower and use simplified language and intervention approaches.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1803 (Number of characters: 243):
For 
example, some older adults may better identify and grasp the concepts of behavioral 
activation (e.g. pleasant events) versus more psychologically complex concepts, such 
as exposure or cognitive/thinking patterns that maintain behaviors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1804 (Number of characters: 2):
2.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1805 (Number of characters: 459):
Inclusion of caregivers and significant others. Although not appropriate for all older 
adults, the inclusion of caregivers may offer unique opportunities for providers to 
engage family or friends for at-risk older adults – especially those facing cognitive 
impairment, increased suicide risk, or social isolation. Caregivers may serve as passive 
supporters or as active members that facilitate treatment planning and/or between-
session skill assignments.

Medically Ill Populations
Patients that present with chronic medical diagnoses or with terminal sickness include a 
wide array of medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancers, HIV/
AIDS, and autoimmune disorders (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1812 (Number of characters: 105):
These vulnerable health populations often have comorbid mental health diagnoses or 
related symptomology.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1813 (Number of characters: 196):
Individuals with chronic or long-term health conditions are two 
to three times more likely to present with mental health disorders, including anxiety and 
depression (Hudson & Moss-Morris, 2019).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1814 (Number of characters: 273):
Due to the likelihood of acute changes in health 
care and status, use of brief CBT techniques is optimal to deal with specific and short-term 
distress concerns. POTENTIAL BRIEF CBT ADAPTATIONS
Providers may consider the following when working with medically ill patients:

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1816 (Number of characters: 183):
Prevalence of health-related distress. Experiencing acute distress in response to 
receiving medical diagnoses or sudden changes to health status are expected within 
this population.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1817 (Number of characters: 100):
Providers should keep in mind that health-related distress may be 
the focus of much of the therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

Patients’ anxiety or depression may be symptoms 
of coping with their changing health status.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1819 (Number of characters: 240):

Module 18: Ending Treatment and Maintaining Changes
OBJECTIVES
• To understand the process for preparing the patient for ending treatment 
•

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1852 (Number of characters: 489):
To learn techniques for preventing relapse 
What Is Ending Treatment, and Why Is It Important To Plan for It?
End-of-treatment planning is the collaborative process of preparing the patients and 
assessing their readiness for ending treatment and moving beyond reliance on the 
provider to apply skills. Planning allows the patient to prepare for the end of treatment, 
to review skills learned in treatment, and to vocalize and problem-solve concerns about 
functioning outside treatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1853 (Number of characters: 111):
All these factors reduce anxiety and allay fears a patient 
might have about ending a therapeutic relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1854 (Number of characters: 5):
When?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1855 (Number of characters: 31):
(Indications/Contraindications)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1856 (Number of characters: 299):
End-of-treatment planning begins at the first session when you give the patient some 
indication of the frequency and duration of treatment. End-of-treatment planning is 
an ongoing process, culminating in the final sessions with a review of treatment and 
introduction of relapse-prevention skills.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1857 (Number of characters: 175):
Patients with personality disorders or disorders of attachment may be particularly 
sensitive to feeling abandoned or upset as a result of ending the therapeutic relationship.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1858 (Number of characters: 324):
For these patients, it is important to discuss treatment termination in an empowering and 
thoughtful way—recognizing and normalizing their fears, assuring them safeguards are in 
place (e.g., emergency resources, booster sessions), and encouraging them via reminders 
that the purpose of CBT is self-management of symptoms.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1859 (Number of characters: 103):
Measurement-based care used throughout treatment will inform an appropriate time for 
end-of-treatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1860 (Number of characters: 179):
You can decide if additional sessions, a complete end-of-treatment, or 
booster sessions are needed depending on the type or intensity of symptoms the patient 
is still reporting.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1861 (Number of characters: 194):
However, measurement-based care should be used in addition to ongoing 
conversations with the patient, your clinical judgment, and clinical requirements and 
procedures of the clinical facility.

How?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1863 (Number of characters: 51):
(Instructions/Handouts) 
REVIEWING WHAT WAS LEARNED

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1864 (Number of characters: 141):
The last session of brief CBT should be spent reviewing and recording the different 
cognitive and behavioral skills the patient has learned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1865 (Number of characters: 103):
Use Socratic questioning to elicit 
this list (“What have you learned as a result of our time together?

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1866 (Number of characters: 163):
Is there anything 
that was particularly meaningful to you about your time in therapy?”), as patients may 
generate skills or benefits of therapy not known to you.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1867 (Number of characters: 74):
Patients should have a list of 

135
these skills they can take with them.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1868 (Number of characters: 141):
They should also be encouraged to keep 
the other handouts (e.g., Thought Records) completed during treatment as a 
reminder of their skills.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1869 (Number of characters: 168):
RELAPSE PREVENTION
Many patients are concerned that they will not be able to manage future psychological 
problems or psychosocial stressors without the aid of therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1870 (Number of characters: 114):
In planning for the end of 
treatment, you and patients anticipate potential stressors and symptoms and plan:  
1)

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1871 (Number of characters: 229):
What tools the patients have learned in therapy that they could use for particular 
stressors/symptoms, and 2) when patients might need to contact a mental health 
professional for additional assistance (e.g., suicidal ideation).

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1872 (Number of characters: 82):
Preparing for inevitable 
difficulties is empowering and encouraging for patients.

--------------------------------------------------

Give Yourself Adequate Time to End Treatment.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1882 (Number of characters: 93):
Plan on an entire session devoted to ending treatment, wrapping up, and maintaining 
changes.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1883 (Number of characters: 176):
It is highly recommended that you not introduce new concepts during the 
final session, as new issues may arise; and ending treatment during the session may 
become impossible.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1884 (Number of characters: 121):
GIVE THE PATIENT CREDIT
Patients often attribute positive change to external entities and negative change to 
themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1885 (Number of characters: 213):
Therefore, at the end of treatment, discuss the patient’s progress (using 
objective data, such as symptom-rating scales, when available), praise the patient, and 
emphasize the patient’s role in positive changes.

chunk 1886 (Number of characters: 313):
ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 18

136
RESPOND TO CONCERNS
Checking in with the patient regularly about questions or concerns about ending 
treatment helps maintain the therapeutic relationship and offset negative emotions about 
treatment that could result in negative outcomes, such as feeling abandoned.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1887 (Number of characters: 175):
If patients 
seem particularly concerned about ending treatment, they could use a Thought Record to 
identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts associated with leaving therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1888 (Number of characters: 348):
PLAN SELF-MANAGEMENT TIME
Patients may be interested in planning self-management time when preparing for the end 
of treatment. Self-management times are a few minutes each week that patients set aside, 
once therapy is complete, to check mood and use of skills and problem solve situations 
or feelings that may be negatively affecting their mood.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1889 (Number of characters: 88):
These times last approximately 
10-15 minutes and follow a structure similar to therapy.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1890 (Number of characters: 156):
Self-management time is beneficial 
because it is free, can be conducted at and when and where it is convenient for the 
patient, and helps prevent relapse.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1891 (Number of characters: 94):
A self-management worksheet (found at the end of this 
module) may be used during these times.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1892 (Number of characters: 137):
BOOSTER SESSIONS
Booster sessions can be scheduled approximately one month following the end of 
treatment and then as needed thereafter.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1893 (Number of characters: 108):
During a booster session, you: 
• Check in with the patient about self-management of symptoms and stressors.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 1894 (Number of characters: 36):
• Refresh skills learned in therapy.

--------------------------------------------------
