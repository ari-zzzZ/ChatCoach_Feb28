For the
Supervisee	• Provides provider performance feedback
• Provides guidance and acquisition of alternative viewpoints
• Contributes to the process of forming a provider’s identity
• Serves as a secure base to explore applications and
therapeutic principles
For the
Patient	• Ensures that patients receive acceptable care
» Providers do no harm
» Providers possess sufficient skills
» Those who lack skills are provided with remediation

==================================================

Format	Description	Advantages	Disadvantages
Verbal
Report	Providers verbally
report the details of a
given therapy session,
or case, to the
supervisor.	• Less threatening to
providers
• Allows free-flowing
discussion between
provider and
supervisor	• Subject to provider recollection
(errors and omissions)
• Limited ability for supervisors
to monitor and provide
feedback on the “process” of
therapy
Process
Notes	Providers write down
and recount issues
identified in session
along with their own
personal reactions and
feelings encountered in
the session.	• Less threatening to
providers
• Provide a more
detailed recount
of the session
(compared with
verbal report alone)
• Begin to identify
provider issues during
session (process)	• Subject to provider focus and
recollection
• Limited ability to monitor
and provide feedback on the
process of therapy
Audio/Video
Recording	Actual sessions
are audio or video
recorded and reviewed
in supervision.	• Provides access to
objective and process
content of sessions
• Serves as an excellent
learning tool	• Can be intimidating to
providers (and sometimes to
patients)
• Logistical issues – specific
informed consent for patients,
availability of equipment
Live
Supervision	The supervisor is in
the room (connected
through audio/visual
technology) with the
supervisee and patient
or watching through a
double-sided window.
The supervisor does
not engage in direct
therapy, but instead the
supervisee consults with
the supervisor in the
presence of the patient.	• Provides the
supervisor with real-
time evidence of
supervisee’s clinical
skills development
• Allows the
supervisee to
enhance therapeutic
approaches and/
or learn alternative
approaches in real-
time with a patient	• Possibility of missing nonverbal
cues during the consulting
encounter if connected by
telephone.
• Possibility of novice providers
being threatened or anxious
• Possibility of patient
discomfort with this approach.
• Possibility of reduction in
credibility of novice provider
with patients if the intent for
this modality is not adequately
explained at the outset
Group
Supervision	Multiple providers
interact with supervisor
in group format.	• Provides provider-to-
provider learning
• Uses all the above
techniques in addition
to group format	• Less individual emphasis,
not as much time for each
individual

==================================================

Stage I. Conformity (All)	None
Everyone “conforms” to the majority society to emulate the way the majority acts,
speaks, dresses, and believes, because the majority is perceived as positive.	None
Stage II.	None
Minority Group	Majority Group
Dissonance
The minority group realizes that its race or
gender may preclude it from the benefits
of the majority group. It begins to see that
racism and sexism may be impacting it.	Acceptance
The majority group can diminish comments
or actions that indicate racism or sexism is
alive. It feels the minority should be more like
it or dismiss the effects of minority status.
Stage III.	None
Immersion
Due to the effects of racism and sexism,
members of minority groups begin to
feel negative emotions towards the
majority group.	Resistance
Members of majority group may feel that
racism and sexism do not exist and can
express beliefs about “reverse racism” or
“reverse sexism.”
Stage IV.	None
Emersion
Anger towards the majority group causes
minorities to associate only with the
group they belong to, avoiding contact
with the majority.	Retreat
When the majority group’s assumptions
about minorities are proven false, it may
feel guilt and shame about how difficult life
is for minorities. It may also feel frustration
towards other members of its own group
who do not agree.
Stage V.	None
Internalization
Minority groups realize that there are
negative qualities about their own people
and that not all members of the majority
group are the enemy. They begin to see that
racism and sexism can be fought against.	Emergence
Members of the majority start to
understand their privilege and how it
continues to benefit them.
Stage VI. Integrative Awareness (All)	None
Both majority and minority group members positively identify their own cultural/racial
identity and acknowledge other aspects of both their own and others’ identities.	None

==================================================

Explicit Bias
Definition: Attitudes and beliefs we have
about a person or group on a conscious level.
Individuals are aware of this bias and express
it directly.	Implicit Bias
Definition: Attitudes and beliefs we have
about a person or group on an unconscious
level. Individuals are unaware of this bias and
express it subconsciously.
General Examples:	None
• A boss choosing not to interview an
applicant after seeing the applicant’s
dreadlocks. The boss feels that dreadlocks
indicate he will not be a good employee or fit
in with the company’s culture.
• A male patient choosing not to work with any
female providers because he assumes they are
all judgmental, incompetent, and unhelpful.	• Assuming a woman working in a hospital is a
nurse instead of a doctor.
• A White individual asking a Latinx individual
where he was born, because she assumes
most Latinx individuals are not U.S. citizens.
Examples in Psychotherapy:	None
• A female provider choosing to refer a
transgender patient to her LGBT colleague,
because she assumes she would not be
able to understand the patient’s needs. She
assumes the patient’s presenting concerns
will be tied to being transgender.
• A male provider skipping over the military
sexual trauma questions during an
assessment with a male veteran. He assumes
only female veterans experience military
sexual trauma.	• A White provider being friendlier with White
patients than with patients of color.
• Appearing concerned or sad when a middle-
aged female patient says she is single and
does not have any children, assuming that
being single would contribute to a negative
emotional state.

Emotional
Processing	The use of reflection to assist in the development of new, more realistic beliefs
about feared objects, activities, or situations. Believed to be one of the critical
active ingredients of exposure therapy.
Extinction	Weakening or removing previously learned associations between feared
objects, activities or situations, and bad outcomes.
Fear vs. Anxiety	Fear -- the emotional and cognitive response to an object or situation of
concern. Anxiety -- the constellation of symptoms that manifest when a feared
response occurs.
Flooding	Starting exposure with the most difficult tasks of the fear hierarchy.
Graded
exposure	The use of a fear hierarchy to systematically and gradually expose an individual
to increasingly distressing objects, situations, or activities.
Habituation	Decreasing the intensity of anxiety reactions to feared objects or situations
over time through repeated exposure.
Panic	Sudden uncontrollable fear or anxiety that often involves psychological
and biological (bodily sensations) reactions. Within exposure therapy, fear
associated with bodily sensations decreased by building tolerance to the
sensation during exposure exercises.
Safety
Behaviors	Behaviors used by patients to tolerate or reduce fear and, thus, avoid exposure
to the feared object or situation. During exposure work, important to monitor
and avoid safety behaviors during exposure exercises. Ultimate goal of
exposure therapy: to translate skills into real-world situations; important to
help patients minimize use of safety behaviors in their daily lives.
Stress	Stress -- the way in which the body responds to any demand or challenge.
Experienced daily by everyone. Importantly, not all stress bad but long-term
stress harmful to health.
SUDs	Subjective units of distress. Commonly used to “quantify” levels of perceived
stress. Typically used on a 0-100 scale.
Systematic
desensitization	Combining exposure with relaxation exercises to make them more manageable.
However, pairing with relaxation may interfere with the exposure experience.
Must be monitored accordingly. Relaxation techniques possibly best used after
the exposure exercise is completed.
Worry	A state of anxiety and uncertainty over actual or potential problems. Usually
related to something impending or anticipated.

==================================================

Myth	Fact
Anxiety is not very
common. People with
anxiety are weak.	Nearly one in five people experiences some type of anxiety
disorder in any given year. Anxiety and stress happen to us all.
Anxiety will get better
over time if you just
leave things alone.	Anxiety and fear lead to avoidance, which maintains the
response over time. Exposure and facing fears and anxiety
are effective at reducing anxiety and fear.
Therapy for anxiety will
take years.	Most anxiety conditions can be treated effectively in 10-
12 weekly sessions. Anxiety reductions can often be seen
within the first weeks of therapy, and some providers offer
abbreviated treatment that involve four to six sessions.
A panic attack can
make you lose control
or pass out.	Fainting usually occurs from a sudden decrease in blood
pressure and is not associated with panic attacks.
Someone with anxiety
should avoid situations
that cause stress.	Avoiding stress often leads to immediate reductions in
anxiety but creates a host of additional problems, including
avoidance and continued fear responses. Often, what feels
natural (e.g., avoiding stress) actually turns out to maintain or
make anxiety worse.

==================================================

Feared Sensation	Exposure Activity
Racing heart	Jumping jacks, running in place, push-ups
Dizziness	Shaking head, chair spinning, twirling in place
Shortness of
