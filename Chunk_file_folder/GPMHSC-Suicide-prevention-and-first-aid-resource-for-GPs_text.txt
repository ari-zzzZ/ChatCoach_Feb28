Early detection of risk – Suicide and the relationship 
with mental disorders
Early intervention for mental health issues is important in maximising the wellbeing of patients.6 On average, GPs see 
more than 80% of the population each year.5 Therefore, the primary care setting is the ideal place for mental health 
issues to be detected and responded to, the risk to be assessed, and for people to seek help as early as possible to 
prevent mental health issues and disorders leading to suicide. It is important that GPs have the knowledge and skills to recognise when a patient might be experiencing mental health 
issues and to investigate whether they might be at risk of suicide. Undertaking regular mental health education and 
training is vital to ensuring your skills and knowledge are up to date.

mental disorders. Also included are some specific warning signs that might indicate someone is thinking about suicide. Suicide
People who are contemplating suicide will often give some clues or signs to those around them, including friends, family, 
colleagues, their GP or other mental health professionals.7 Preventing suicide starts with recognising and acting on 
warning signs, which usually occur in combination, and being aware of the specific risk factors involved.

Bipolar disorder
Bipolar disorder
Research indicates that the symptoms of bipolar disorder are often mistaken for, and result in a diagnosis 
of, unipolar depression.14

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 12 (Number of characters: 1480):
This is because patients with bipolar disorder usually experience or present more 
commonly with depressive symptoms, and might not recognise and/or report hypomanic or manic episodes.15
Manic episodes may involve changes in mood, behaviour, energy, sleep, and cognition, and might be 
characterised by a positive mood, irritability, inappropriate behaviour and heightened creativity.16 Did you know …
People with bipolar disorder have a much higher risk of suicide (about eight times) than the general population.15 
Treating misdiagnosed bipolar disorder with antidepressant medication can worsen manic and hypomanic symptoms, 
so keep this in mind if a patient presents with depressive symptoms.17

Talking about suicide and mental health issues
If you are concerned about a patient and have noticed some signals of risk, it is important to ask questions to make sure 
you identify and act on risk factors. Beginning a conversation about suicide
Research shows that the relationship between the GP and the patient can often be one of the most important factors 
in reducing self-harm ideation – for example, the GP demonstrating empathy and a willingness to discuss emotional 
concerns.18
Make reassuring statements like:
‘It’s my job to make sure you’re doing OK.

--------------------------------------------------

I have some concerns that things might not be going so well for you at the

chunk 14 (Number of characters: 632):
Is it OK if we have a bit of a chat about how you are?’ Sometimes it can be daunting asking difficult questions about suicide and mental illness for fear of prying, upsetting 
the person, stigmatising your patients9 or putting ideas in their head. However, the first step to supporting people 
considering suicide is to begin a conversation about it. By being calm, non-judgemental and empathetic, a GP provides 
an opportunity for a client to discuss their suicidal thoughts. They can be encouraged to tell their story, outline their 
stresses, provide information about their history, and describe their current suicidal thoughts.

Responding to patients who might be at risk of suicide
If patients disclose symptoms, thoughts or feelings that might indicate a mental illness, mental health issue or suicidality, 
some things that might help you work positively with your patients, are to:
•	 normalise your patient’s feelings
•	 use people first language – talk about mental health issues, mental illness and mental disorders as being separate to 
the person, not as defining them
•	 give patients clear messages of recovery
•	 acknowledge how scary it must feel to have thoughts of suicide.

chunk 29 (Number of characters: 900):
However, a crippling fear of one thing renders all others as inconsequential. While anxiety might be seen 
as an irrational feeling by an outsider, it might be completely rational to the person.19
Part of the problem with the way services and the community respond to mental health issues is the stigma that 
is associated with mental illness. You can help to reduce the problems caused by stigma by normalising mental health issues and by talking about 
mental illness/conditions/disorders the same way you would about physical illness/conditions/disorders. The information below includes mental health analogies and strategies that might assist you to normalise mental 
health issues and reduce stigma for your patients. Using ‘people first’ language
When talking to patients about mental health issues, the language that you use can really impact how the person thinks 
and feels about themselves.

chunk 30 (Number of characters: 213):

and less isolated.’ Give hope of recovery
Most people who receive treatment and ongoing support for a mental illness can learn to adapt their life to the illness 
(seen as recovery). It is important for mental health professionals to give patients hope of recovery, acknowledging that 
the term ‘recovery’ has different meanings for different people and is better conceptualised as a personal journey rather 
than as an having an end point.20 In supporting people on their personal journey to recovery, the external environment 
(including services providing treatment and care) also has a role to play in assisting with the recovery journey. For 
example, GPs might focus on the individual by:
•	 acknowledging his/her strengths, talents, interests and limitations
•	 acknowledging his/her rights to full partnership in all aspects of their recovery
•	 promoting the rights of people to make choices regarding their own desired goals and outcomes
•	 projecting a belief in the inherent capacity of the individual to recover.21
While it can be the case for some people, recovery in a mental health context doesn’t necessarily mean being rid of 
all symptoms or returning to function without the symptoms first presented (as it might be for a person recovering 
from influenza or a chest infection, for example).

--------------------------------------------------

Is your patient struggling to see past their mental illness/issue/condition and thoughts of suicide? ‘It is possible for you to get through this.’
‘You managed to get through [insert previous life challenge], so I am confident you will be able to find a way 
through this.’
‘I have worked with lots of other people who experienced similar feelings to you, and we have found a way 
through.’ ‘Living with a mental health issue is only one small part of you … don’t forget to think about your strengths and 
other positive aspects about who you are.’
Did you know … 
Recovery for individuals with mental illness can mean gaining and retaining hope, understanding one’s abilities and 
disabilities, engaging in an active life, developing personal autonomy, developing a social identity, connecting meaning 
and purpose in life, and fostering a positive sense of self.22

Suicide prevention – Risk assessment in general practice
Why complete a suicide risk assessment? An effective treatment plan that supports and manages clients at risk of suicide should be informed by a thorough risk 
assessment.23 A risk assessment is a direct conversation with a patient about their suicidal thoughts, plans and intent; it 
is a matter-of-fact empathetic conversation that allows patients to discuss suicide openly. A suicide risk assessment brings together key information about a patient’s current mental state, any current or 
previous risk and protective factors, any key stresses contributing to the risk, and a review of current supports. It is the 
combination of these factors and identified warning signs that contribute to a patient’s overall level of risk for suicide. GPs should consider completing a thorough risk assessment for any patients they are concerned may be at elevated 
risk due to their current mental state and/or significant life stresses.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 39 (Number of characters: 141):
Some patients will outline their suicidal thinking 
quite openly, while others will need encouragement to share these thoughts with their GP.

There are a range of tools that can guide GPs through the completion of a risk assessment. Often the use of these

It is generally agreed upon by experts in the field of suicide risk assessment, that it is the combination of warning signs,

patient’s safety, and what additional treatment and/or support would be useful to put in place over the coming days and 
weeks. Options for consideration include an urgent mental health assessment, a non-urgent appointment with a health 
professional, ongoing support from the GP, increased community and peer support, or a combination of one or more of 
these initiatives. Where there is any doubt about the level of risk, GPs can contact their local crisis mental health service 
for consultation and follow up. Risk assessments provide a forum for open conversation about suicidal thinking, and can help patients to establish 
hope and maintain a positive belief in their lives.

Now what? Suicide safety planning in general practice
Introduction
Safety planning provides a structured approach that empowers people to manage psychological distress and suicidal 
thoughts, thus aiming to reduce their immediate risk of engaging in suicidal behaviour.26 It involves the person – ideally 
with support from a health professional – identifying coping and help-seeking strategies that are tailored for their needs, 
situation and personal relationships. The resulting safety plan is then used during times of distress and crisis. When to do a safety plan
A safety plan can be a useful therapeutic tool when someone is ambivalent about living or dying, whether these thoughts 
are vague or intense in nature, as it can help to contain distress and offer ideas for improving their mental health. Safety 
planning is most pertinent when a GP understands the risk of suicide to be serious in nature.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 51 (Number of characters: 245):
An appointment with a GP might be the first and only contact that the person has with a health professional and as such, 
offers a unique opportunity to influence a person’s safety and begin to create a roadmap for improving their mental health.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 52 (Number of characters: 122):
Documenting a safety plan
A safety plan can be documented on a paper template or via e-resources such as websites or apps.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 53 (Number of characters: 291):
The BeyondNow 
app provides a simple-to-use tool for people to refer to on their phones (download at the Apple App Store or Google 
Play), or to complete online and email to themselves. BeyondNow gives people access to their safety plan whenever they feel their level of distress increasing.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 54 (Number of characters: 138):
They can refer 
to their safety plan at any appointments with their health professionals and share it with their family and close friends.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 55 (Number of characters: 104):
Start by downloading the app from the Apple App Store or Google Play and familiarising yourself with it.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 56 (Number of characters: 871):
You can also 
check out a quick introduction here, to the different features, including editing and sharing a plan. Apps might not be for everyone, so first consider whether using an app for safety planning is appropriate for your 
individual patients. It is then important to consider how you are going to introduce it to your patients; including 
information about the strengths and limitation of the app, when they might use it, as well as a reminder that this is a 
confidential plan that they can choose to share with those they find supportive. Key steps of safety planning
When you’re supporting your patient to create their plan, asking questions can help them think about what might work 
for their situation and ensure the identified strategies meet their individual needs. Below are a range of questions that seek to find the key information for a safety plan.

Some people may not wish to complete a particular step or steps in the safety plan.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 77 (Number of characters: 545):
Their plan is unique to them and is 
all about keeping safe, so if certain steps aren’t helpful or create an additional source of burden, stress or conflict, these 
can be left out. Safety plans are designed to be followed step by step. However, it’s important to reinforce with your client that if they 
feel at imminent risk and are unable to remain safe – even for a short period of time – they should phone or present to an 
emergency service. Reviewing the safety plan
A safety plan should be modified over time to ensure its effectiveness.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 78 (Number of characters: 1022):
At a follow-up appointment GPs should ask their 
patient:
•	 How often they have needed to use the plan? •	 What the most useful aspect of the safety plan was?
•	 Were there any barriers to its use?
•	 How they can continue to use the safety plan? Safety planning is a practical and accessible strategy that can assist GPs to help patients to manage difficult emotions in 
a self-directed manner, while also guiding them as to when to seek out the support of other health professionals. Safety planning resources

Ongoing care for your patients
Even if you’re satisfied that your patient is not at immediate risk of harm, it is still important to initiate appropriate follow-
up to prevent gaps in the mental healthcare of your patients. Some possible follow up actions might be:
•	 to make a plan for a follow-up appointment to develop a GP Mental Health Treatment Plan (GPMHTP)
•	 if you’ve already prepared a GPMHTP, you might make plans to refer the patient on to an allied health professional 
(ensure that you follow up with your patient if this is your plan of action)
•	 to introduce a follow-up text messaging service to remind patients about a scheduled appointment or to encourage 
them to make a follow-up appointment 
•	 to set the patient some homework or refer them to an e-mental health resource to ensure a follow-up plan is in place
•	 to work on some activity scheduling with your patient over the period of time until you see them next/they have an 
appointment with an allied health practitioner
•	 to provide some psychoeducation to your patients (and their family/carer if applicable) explaining and normalising 
their mental health condition/issue
•	 if you are an eligible Focused Psychological Strategies (FPS) provider, you might schedule in some FPS sessions with 
your patient
•	 to give your patient hope – with the right treatment, most people will be able to manage their illness and live a normal 
life. Further reading and resources

Suicide prevention and first aid:  
A resource for GPs
Ongoing care for you
It is important for GPs who spend a lot of time working with patients with mental health issues/people at risk of suicide, 
to be mindful of their own mental health and their risk of burnout.

--------------------------------------------------

chunk 86 (Number of characters: 1482):
Burnout is a syndrome of emotional exhaustion, 
depersonalisation and reduced personal accomplishment that can occur among individuals who work with people in 
some capacity.27 
Burnout might occur when GPs face repeated exposure to traumatic and distressing experiences of others28 and highly 
stressful situations such as working with a patient who is at high risk of suicide. It has been suggested that GPs are 
less likely to suffer from burnout when they regularly engage in educational activities to maintain, develop or increase 
their knowledge and skills.29 To reduce the risk of burnout, ensure you include some self-care strategies as part of your 
ongoing continuing professional development (CPD). Reducing the risk of burnout
•	 Seek out supervision/consultation (individual or group) 
•	 Make time for activities that are relaxing or de-stressing, such as exercise, spending time with friends, hobbies
•	 Engage in regular mental health CPD activities, such as small group learning sessions
